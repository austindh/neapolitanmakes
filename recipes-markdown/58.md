### Lemon White Chocolate Chip Cookies  
Yields: 18-20 cookies  
  
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  
1/2 cup light brown sugar  
1/4 cup dark brown sugar  
1/4 cup white sugar  
1 egg  
1/2 tsp lemon juice  
1 1/2 cups flour  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
zest of 1 lemon  
3/4 cup white chocolate chips  
  
1\. Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and lemon juice and beat for about 1 more minute.  
  
2\. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest. Add slowly to the butter/sugar mixture until just incorporated. Add in the white chocolate chips and mix until they're evenly distributed.  
  
3\. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Scoop cookies out onto a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes \[they will appear to be not done, but they will continue cooking after you take them out\]. Let the cookies sit on the pan for 10 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack.
