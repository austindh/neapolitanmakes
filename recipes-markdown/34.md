Yields: 30 small cookies  
**Cookies**  
    
1 cup flour  
1/3 cup cocoa powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  
2/3 cup sugar  
1 egg, separated yolk and white  
2 tbsp milk  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 1/4 tsp finely chopped pecans AND/OR shredded coconut   
    
**Caramel Filling**  
    
15 soft caramel candies (I used Werther's Original)  
1-2 tbsp cream  
    
**Chocolate Drizzle**  
    
1/4 cup chocolate chips   
1/2 tsp vegetable oil  
    
	
1\. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar. Add in the egg yolk, milk, and vanilla. Add in the dry ingredients.   
    
2\. Put the dough, covered, in the fridge for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.   
    
3\. Whisk the egg white in a small bowl until slightly frothy. Using a teaspoon, scoop out the cookie dough. Roll it into a ball and dip into the egg white, then roll in the pecans (or coconut).   
    
4\. Place them 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet. Press the center slightly down with a teaspoon. Bake for 8-12 minutes.   
    
5\. Let the cookies cool. Melt the caramel and cream together for about 45 seconds. Stir and put into a sandwich bag. Cut off a small bit of the corner and squeeze a little bit on each cookie.  
    
6\. Melt the chocolate and oil together. Put it into a sandwich bag and cut off a small bit of the corner and drizzle on the cookies.
