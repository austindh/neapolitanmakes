### Mushroom, Onion, and Pepper Jack Tarts  
#### AKA Magic Tarts  
Yield: 9 three inch tarts  
    
2 tbsp olive oil   
1 tbsp butter  
1/2 cup chopped white onion  
2 cloves garlic, chopped  
1 cup chopped mushroom (any variety, I used shiitake and baby bella together)  
1/4 cup chicken broth  
1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese  
1 egg  
1 tbsp half and half (or milk or cream)  
1 Sheet Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry, thawed (if your local store has generic brand I'm really jealous. I've never found anything even close to Pepperidge Farm) The box comes with two sheets, but this recipe only needs one.   
    
1\. In a pan on low-medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil. Saute the onion and garlic until the onion is grilled (a little brown on the edges)

2\. Add the mushroom and chicken broth. Simmer until the chicken broth is evaporated. (15 minutes)  
    
3\. Open up the trifold Puff Pastry. Using a biscuit cutter, cut out nine circles.   
    
4\. Beat the egg and half and half together. Using a pastry brush, brush a little of the egg wash on each circle of Puff Pastry.
