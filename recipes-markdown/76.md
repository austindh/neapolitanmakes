### Lemon-Blueberry Pound Cake  
Yields: 1 loaf  
  
1 1/3 cup flour  
1/4 tsp baking soda  
pinch of salt  
1 stick of butter, softened  
3/4 cup sugar  
1 tbsp lemon zest  
2 eggs  
1/2 sour cream  
2 tbsp milk  
3 tbsp lemon juice  
1/2 cup blueberries  
  
1 cup powdered sugar  
3 tbsp lemon juice  
  
1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease and lightly flour a 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan.  
  
2\. Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. In a separate medium bowl, cream butter, sugar, and lemon zest for about 4 minutes on a high speed until it's light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for about 30 seconds after each egg.  
  
3\. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and milk. To the butter mixture, add the flour and the sour cream mixtures, alternating between the two while mixing. Add the lemon juice and beat for 1 minute so it's well incorporated.  
  
4\. Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes for an 8x4 or 45-50 minutes for a 9x5.  
  
5\. Whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice and glaze over the pound cake when it's still warm.  
  
6\. Enjoy!
