Angel Food Cupcakes
  
Yields: 16 cupcakes  
  
3/4 cup + 2 tbsp sugar  
1/2 cup cake flour (or 1/2 cup AP flour + 1/2 tsp cornstarch)  
1/4 tsp salt  
6 egg whites, room temperature  
2 1/2 tbsp warm water  
1/2 tsp vanilla  
3/4 tsp cream of tartar  
  
1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin tins with paper liners.  
  
2\. Combine half the sugar with the flour and salt.  
  
3\. In a large bowl, combine the egg whites, water, vanilla, cream of tartar, and remaining sugar. Whip together with a whisk until medium peaks form.  
  
4\. Sift a small amount of the dry ingredients into the egg whites, then fold in with a spatula. Do this in at least 6 batches to ensure even folding.  
  
5\. Fill muffin cups all the way to the top with batter and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and a toothpick comes out clean.  
  
6\. Fill with jam, if desired. Top with sweetened whipped cream (add a small amount of vanilla for an awesome taste), then garnish with berries.
