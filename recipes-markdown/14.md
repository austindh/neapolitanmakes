Homemade Oreos
  
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  
1 cup sugar  
1 egg  
1 tsp vanilla  
2 cups flour  
3/4 cup cocoa powder, dutch process   
1 1/2 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp salt  
    
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  
1 tsp vanilla  
3 cups powdered sugar  
2 tbsp cream (or half & half or milk)  
    
	
1\. Using a mixer, cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated.   
    
2\. Add the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined. Divide the dough in half and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.   
    
3\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut out into desired shapes. Bake for 10-12 minutes on a lined baking sheet (I line it with my silpat, but you can use parchment paper).   
    
4\. Let cool on a cooling rack and make the filling. Beat the butter for 30 seconds on medium, then add the vanilla. Add the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, then add the cream as necessary to thin it to the desired consistency.   
    
5\. Fill and serve. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.
