Eggnog Pound Cake  
Yields: 1 loaf  
  
**Loaf**:  
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  
1 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
1 1/2 cup flour  
pinch of salt  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp cinnamon  
1/4 tsp nutmeg  
3/4 cup eggnog  
1 tsp vanilla  
  
**Glaze**:  
1/2 cup powdered sugar  
1 tbsp (or more for desired consistency) eggnog  
  
  
1\. Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. Grease an 8 x 4 loaf pan.  
  
2\. Cream the butter and sugar together for 3-4 minutes with a mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time.  
  
3\. Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl.  
  
4\. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and the eggnog to the creamed butter/sugar combo. Add vanilla, then mix until _just_ combined.  
  
5\. Bake for 40-60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  
  
6\. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove. Let it cool completely before adding the glaze.
