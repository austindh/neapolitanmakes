Sandwich Bread Loaves

Yields: 2-10 loaves, depending on the size 

1/2 cup warm water
1/2 tsp sugar
1 tbsp (1 packet) yeast
2 cups warm water
2 tbsp sugar
2 tsp salt
2 tbsp oil 
5+ cups flour (more if needed, depending on your humidity and temperature)
1 egg with a splash of cold water for egg wash


1\. Combine 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp sugar, and yeast. Stir until dissolved and let activate for 10 minutes. 

2\. While the yeast is activating, mix together the remaining water, sugar, salt, and oil in large bowl (I use my Kitchenaid). Stir to combine. Add the yeast mixture and 2 cups flour and mix. 

3\. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough starts to remove from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the mixer or by hand until the dough slightly springs back when you press your finger into it. Let rise, covered, in a greased bowl until it's doubled in size. 

4\. Punch down dough and shape into the desired shape. Let rise for 30-40 minutes, until puffy. Score the dough with a sharp knife and brush the loaves with an egg wash. 

5\. Bake at 375 degrees until the loaves sound hollow when tapped. For the smaller sandwich loaves, it takes about 20 minutes. Larger loaves will probably take 30-40 minutes.
