Blueberry Cinnamon Toast Crunch Muffins
  
Yields: 15-18 muffins  
  
2 cups flour  
1 cup sugar  
1 tbsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp cinnamon  
2 eggs  
1 cup milk  
1/4 cup vegetable oil  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 cup fresh blueberries  
1/2 cup Cinnamon Toast Crunch  
1 tbsp butter, melted  
  
  
1\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Line a muffin tin with muffin papers. Crush the Cinnamon Toast Crunch in a food processor or in a bag using a rolling pin.  
  
2\. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon) with a whisk.  
  
3\. In a medium bowl, combine wet ingredients (eggs, milk, oil, vanilla). Pour into the dry ingredients and stir with a silicone spatula until just combined, but still lumpy. Fold in the blueberries. Fold in half of the crushed cereal.  
  
4\. Scoop the muffin batter evenly into the liners, until about 3/4 full. Combine the remaining crushed cereal and the melted butter. Sprinkle atop the muffins and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
