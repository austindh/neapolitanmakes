### Original Girl Scout Sugar Cookies  
I got the recipe from the [Girl Scout Website](http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/cookie_history/early_years.asp).   
Yield: 6-7 dozen thin cookies  
    
1 cup (2 sticks) butter (I used salted)  
1 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
2 tbsp milk  
1 tsp vanilla (they're sugar cookies so try to use clear if you have it)  
2 cups flour  
1 tsp salt  
2 tsp baking powder  
    
Sugar for topping, if desired

1\. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

2\. Add eggs, one at a time. Beat until it's mixed in fully.

_Double yolk! I've never seen this before!_  
    
    
3\. Add milk and vanilla.

4\. Mix together flour, salt, and baking powder. Add them in, slowly, to the wet mixture.

As you can see, it's REALLY sticky. That's normal.   
    
5\. Refrigerate dough wrapped in plastic wrap for 1 hour.

_Thanks, Siri!_  
At this point, I was looking through photos to bring to the party. I've decided to share this one for your viewing pleasure.

_Everyone at once: D'awwwwwwww!_  
    
6\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Roll out dough onto floured surface with floured rolling pin. Cut into trefoil shapes, or just 2"-3" circles. I bent a football cutter into the best trefoil I could make, because seriously, I do not need a football cookie cutter.   
    
Keep in mind this dough is SOFT. I had to roll it out and then freeze it for about 3-5 minutes before cutting it out, but that made it _so_ easy. I found the cookies did best if they were rolled out very thin. Sprinkle with sugar.

_See how the cookie stays stiff on the spatula? It's frozen. _  
    
7\. Bake on a silpat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet for 8-10 minutes (if _really_ thin, 6-7 minutes), or until golden around the edges.
