 Original Girl Scout Sugar Cookies  
Yield: 6-7 dozen thin cookies  
    
1 cup (2 sticks) butter (I used salted)  
1 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
2 tbsp milk  
1 tsp vanilla (they're sugar cookies so try to use clear if you have it)  
2 cups flour  
1 tsp salt  
2 tsp baking powder  
    
Sugar for topping, if desired  
    
    
    
1\. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  
    
    
2\. Add eggs, one at a time. Beat until it's mixed in fully.   
    
    
    
3\. Add milk and vanilla.   
    
    
    
4\. Mix together flour, salt, and baking powder. Add them in, slowly, to the wet mixture.   
    
    
    
5\. Refrigerate dough wrapped in plastic wrap for 1 hour.   
    
    
6\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Roll out dough onto floured surface with floured rolling pin. Cut into trefoil shapes, or just 2"-3" circles. I bent a football cutter into the best trefoil I could make, because seriously, I do not need a football cookie cutter.   
    
    
7\. Bake on a silpat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet for 8-10 minutes (if _really_ thin, 6-7 minutes), or until golden around the edges.
