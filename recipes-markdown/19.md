Soft Sugar Cookies
  
Yields: 2-3 dozen (depending on the size)   
    
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  
1 cup sugar  
1 egg   
1 tsp vanilla  
2 tbsp milk or cream  
3 cups flour  
1 1/2 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp salt  
    

1\. Cream together butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes on high. Add egg, vanilla, and milk and incorporate well.  
    
2\. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add slowly to the wet ingredients, mixing well as you go. Cover and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.   
    
3\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Roll out the dough about 1/4" thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out in desired shapes and move onto a silpat-lined or parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, depending on your preference. (I liked them at 8 minutes because I love them really soft.)
