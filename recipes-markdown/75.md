Lemon Cheesecake   
Yield: 1 9-inch cheesecake  
    
1 1/2 cups gingersnaps, smashed to smithereens  
3 tbsp sugar  
5 tbsp butter, melted  
    
4-5 8 oz packages of cream cheese, room temperature  
1 cup sugar  
3 eggs  
1 cup sour cream  
1/2 tsp vanilla  
3 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
zest of 1 lemon  
    

1\. Mix the crushed gingersnaps, sugar, and butter together until all the gingersnaps are moistened (I used my pastry cutter). Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and bake at 325 for 10 minutes.   
    
2\. Beat the cream cheese and sugar together for about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat between each. Add the sour cream and beat. Add the vanilla, lemon juice, and zest. Beat.   
    
3\. Pour it into the crust and bake for approximately 1 hour at 325 degrees fahrenheit. Bake with a pan of water on a rack below the cheesecake.   
    
4\. When it's done, it will be jiggly all over and more jiggly in the middle. Don't remove it from the oven-- crack the oven and turn it off. Keep it open for about 10 minutes, then close for about 30. Do this twice.   
    
5\. Refrigerate for about 4 hours.
