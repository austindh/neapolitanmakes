Lemon Buttermilk Sheet Cake
  
Yields: 24-30 servings (fewer servings if you make it in a 9x13)  
    
**Cake**  
2 1/2 cups cake flour (or 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour + 5 tbsp cornstarch)  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
3/4 cup buttermilk  
1/4 cup lemon juice  
1 tsp vanilla  
12 tbsp butter (1 1/2 sticks)   
1 1/2 cup sugar  
3 eggs + 1 egg yolk  
1 tbsp lemon zest  
    
**Glaze**  
3 cups powdered sugar  
3 tbsp lemon juice  
2 tbsp buttermilk  
1/4 cup sugar  


1.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. Grease and flour a cookie sheet. 
2.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 
3.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla. 
4.  In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, then add the lemon zest. 
5.  Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients, to the butter mixture. Mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 15-22 minutes, until set. 
6.  Mix together the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and buttermilk to make the glaze (it will be thick). Pour on the hot cake and spread it on the cake. Immediately sprinkle the sugar on top of the glaze. Slice with a plastic spatula or knife and enjoy!
