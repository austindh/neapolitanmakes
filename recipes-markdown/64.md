Blueberry Galette  
Yields: 9 inch galette  
  
1 recipe [Flakiest Pie Crust](/2012/11/the-perfect-pumpkin-pie-and-flakiest.html)  
  
3 cups fresh blueberries  
3 tbsp flour  
1/3 cup sugar  
  
1 egg  
Sugar for sprinkling  
  
  
1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  
  
2\. Roll out the raw pie crust dough to about a 13 inch circle. Don't try to make it perfect-- it just needs to roughly be a circle. Imperfection is what makes it a galette!  
  
3\. Transfer the raw dough to a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper.  
  
4\. Put the blueberries in a medium bowl. Top with flour and sugar. Mix so that all of the blueberries are coated. If you need to add more flour and sugar, do so.  
  
5\. Put the coated blueberries in the center of the rolled-out dough and fold up the edges of the dough over the outer edges of the berries. Brush the beaten egg with a pastry brush on the dough that's folded up. Sprinkle the sugar on the egg washed dough.  
  
6\. Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes, or until crust turns golden.
