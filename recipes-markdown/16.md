Kentucky Butter Bundt
  
Yields: approximately 12 servings   
    
**Cake**  
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  
2 cups sugar  
4 eggs  
1 tbsp vanilla  
3 cups flour  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/2 tsp baking soda  
1 cup buttermilk  
    
**Glaze**  
1/3 cup butter  
3/4 cup sugar  
2 tbsp water  
2 tsp vanilla  
    
1\. Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. Grease a bundt pan liberally with butter or shortening, getting into every nook and cranny. Lightly sprinkle with flour and tap out the excess.  
2\. Place all the cake ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a bowl with a hand mixer). Mix on low for 30 seconds, then up to medium (about a 4) for 3 minutes.   
    
3\. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 55-75 minutes (it totally depends on your oven and altitude), or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.   
    
4\. Prepare the glaze by combining all of the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low. Stir until everything melts and dissolves together, but make sure you don't boil it.   
    
5\. Right when the cake comes out of the oven, poke holes in it with a knife. **Keep the cake in the pan**! Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, letting it soak in as you go.   
    
6\. Let the cake cool completely (I covered it and left it overnight) before inverting. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.   
    
**Note**: Cake is best if you make it the day before so it can cool in the pan overnight.
