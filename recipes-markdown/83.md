### Mini Red Velvet Cupcakes  
Yields: 36 adorably mini cupcakes  
    
Ingredients:  
    
1/2 cup buttermilk (1/2 cup milk plus 1 tsp white vinegar)  
3/4 cup vegetable oil  
1 egg  
1 tsp red food coloring  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
3/4 cup granulated sugar

1 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder  
    
Best Ever Cream Cheese Frosting  
    
1 (8 oz) block cream cheese, slightly softened  
5 tbsp butter (slightly softened-- pliable but not room temperature)  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
2 cups powdered sugar  
    
1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Line the mini muffin pans with 36 mini cupcake papers.   
    
2\. Mix the buttermilk, vegetable oil, egg, food coloring, and vanilla extract with a hand mixer on the lowest setting until it's well incorporated.

_It looks like I had a red egg._  
    
3\. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking soda, and cocoa powder. Add the dry ingredients slowly to the wet ingredients with the hand mixer until there are no more lumps.   
    
4\. Using a cookie scoop, scoop the batter into the mini cupcake papers, filling each one up almost 3/4 of the way up.

_Super out of focus. Sorry, guys. _  
    
5\. Tap the filled muffin pans lightly on the counter a few times to get the bubbles out. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, or until they bounce back up when you touch the top. (You can also test with a toothpick but I always just touch the top. If your finger leaves a dent, they're not ready.)  
    
6\. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, combine the cream cheese and butter. Whip until it's light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix. Really slowly, add the powdered sugar while the mixer is going. Mix it until it's really smooth and fluffy.   
    
7\. Tape the corner of a quart-sized bag (for reinforcement), then cut the corner off about 1/2 inch from the very tip. Insert a decorator's star tip. Add the frosting to the bag and decorate the cupcakes once they've cooled. Add sprinkles (because sprinkles make everything happier).
