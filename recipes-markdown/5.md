Jam-filled Donuts

Yields: 18-24 donuts
Time: 2 hours

2 tbsp warm water
1 tbsp yeast
3/4 cup warm whole milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 egg
3 tbsp butter, softened
2 1/2 to 3 cups flour
Vegetable oil (for frying)

sugar
raspberry jam


1\. Combine warm water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let the yeast activate for 5 minutes. 

2\. To the yeast, add warm milk, sugar, salt, egg, butter, and 1 cup flour. Stir to combine. Slowly add the remaining flour, until the dough is mixed. I always take out the dough to knead by hand for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to make sure the dough is smooth. Let rise in a covered, greased bowl in a warm place until doubled in size. 

3. Cut a piece of parchment paper into 4" squares. Roll dough out on a floured surface until just over 1/2" thick. Cut into circles with a 2" cutter. Sprinkle flour onto parchment square before placing each donut on a square. Let rise, covered, until nearly doubled. 

4\. Heat oil to 350 degrees fahrenheit in a heavy-bottomed pan or fryer. Fry 2-3 donuts at a time, 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Remove and let sit for 1-2 minutes on a paper-towel lined drying rack. Then, throw the donuts around in a bag with sugar until coated. 

5\. Put jam into a freezer bag with the corner cut off or decorating bag with a round tip. Use a chopstick to poke a hole in the side of each donut, then fill with jam.
