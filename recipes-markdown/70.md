Best Cinnamon Swirl Bread  
Yields: 1 loaf  
  
1 1/2 tsp salt  
1/3 cup brown sugar  
2 tbsp margarine  
3/4 cup hot water  
3/4 cup cold water  
1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast  
4 cups bread flour (the original recipe calls for AP flour but I used bread flour)  
  
3/4 cup sugar  
2 tbsp cinnamon  
  
  
1\. Mix the salt, brown sugar, margarine, hot water, cold water, and active dry yeast together. Let the yeast proof for about 8 minutes.  
  
2\. Add the flour and knead for 6-8 minutes. Put it in a greased bowl and let it rise for 1 1/2 hours.  
  
3\. Mix cinnamon and sugar. Roll out the dough to be as wide as the loaf pan you're putting it in and as long as you can reasonably make it. Spray with a little bit of water or spread about 1 tbsp of butter across the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar all over and roll it up. Put it in a greased pan and let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm place.  
  
4\. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until golden on top.
