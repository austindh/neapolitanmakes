Blueberry Streusel Muffins  
    
1 3/4 cups flour  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
1/4 cup sugar  
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 1/2 cups blueberries (I used more like 2 cups-- hey, I like blueberries!)  
1 large egg, at room temperature  
3/4 cup milk  
1/3 vegetable oil  
    
1/4 cup flour  
1/4 cup sugar  
2 tbsp cold butter  
    

1\. Sift the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder into a large bowl. Sprinkle over the blueberries. Beat the egg well then add the milk and oil and mix well together (don’t beat as this makes the muffins tough).  
2\. Scoop using a cookie scoop into buttered muffin tins or paper-lined muffin tins, filling the tins to the top.  
3\. Using a pastry cutter or a fork, cut the butter into the flour and sugar for the streusel topping. Cut until it resembles large crumbs.  
4\. Bake in an oven preheated to 425°F for 15-16 minutes, or until risen and golden. Remove from the oven, leave in the tray for 5 minutes, then flip out with a small knife onto a cooling rack.
