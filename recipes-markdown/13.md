Brioche Buns
  
Makes 8 large buns (you can adjust the size as you desire)  
    
1 cup warm water  
2 tsp yeast  
2 tbsp sugar  
2 eggs, divided use  
3 1/3 cups flour  
1 1/2 tsp salt  
2 1/2 tbsp butter, softened  
    
	
1\. Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir until dissolved and let it stand 5 minutes, until foamy.   
    
2\. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, salt, and butter. Turn on the mixer with a paddle attachment until the butter makes small crumbs.   
    
3\. Stir in one egg and yeast mixture. Using the dough hook attachment, knead for 6-8 minutes. Add more flour if necessary so the dough isn't too sticky. The dough should remove from the sides of the bowl, but not the bottom.   
    
4\. Let rise, covered,  in a slightly warm oven, until doubled in size (45 minutes or so). Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape into round balls. Cover and let rise in a slightly warm oven until they're puffy.   
    
5\. Brush with a beaten egg and bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Place a pan with some water in it in the oven with the buns.   
    
6\. Store in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
