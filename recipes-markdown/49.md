Yields 24 muffins  
    
8 oz cream cheese (room temp)  
1 cup powdered sugar  
1/2 tsp vanilla  
    
4 eggs  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
1 can pumpkin purée   
1 1/4 cup vegetable oil  
    
3 cups AP flour  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1 tsp nutmeg  
1 tsp cloves  
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp baking soda  
    
1/2 cup sugar  
5 tbsp flour  
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon  
4 tbsp cold butter, cut into pieces  
    
	
1\. Beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Set aside.   
    
2\. Preheat oven to 350. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine eggs, sugar, pumpkin, and veggie oil.  
    
3\. While that's beating, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Slowly add this to the wet ingredients.   
    
4\. Using a food scoop, scoop batter about halfway up muffin papers in a muffin tin. Make small indents  in the batter and add about 1 tsp of the cream cheese mixture. Cover the cream cheese with about 1 tbsp more of the pumpkin batter.   
    
5\. Using a pastry cutter, cut together sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter until it resembles crumbs. Sprinkle atop the unbaked muffins.
