_This is a pastry cutter. _  
    
    
3\. Slowly add the water while cutting until it's incorporated and flaky but sticks together.   
    
4\. Form into a ball with your hands and flatten slightly so it's a disk shape. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour, up to 1 day. You can freeze it for up to a month, as long as you thaw it for 24 hours in the fridge before using.   
    
5\. Roll it out and transfer to a pie pan. Cut the extra on the edges of the pie pan. "Fork" the crust. Preheat oven to 425 F. Refrigerate pie crust for 15 minutes while the oven is heating.   
    
6\. Bake for 15 minutes, making sure to puncture the crust with a fork if it gets puffy while it's baking.
