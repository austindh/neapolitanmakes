Makes: about 30 cookies  
    
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened    
1 cup sugar  
1 egg  
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  
1/2 teaspoon clear vanilla extract  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with silpat or parchment paper.   
    
2\. Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add egg, lemon juice, and vanilla. Beat for about 30 more seconds.
