Beat together egg yolks in a small bowl. Temper the egg yolks with warm milk by ladling some warm milk into the egg yolks, then pour the yolk-milk mixture back into the pot.   \n    \n3\\.

Put puff pastry on the counter to defrost. Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit. Unfold puff pastry and cut into equally-sized strips. Make a lattice on a cookie sheet and pop it in the freezer.\\*\\*\\*  \n  \n2\\. In a large pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, carrots, potatoes, and salt. Sauté until the vegetables start to soften. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook 1-2 minutes more.  \n  \n3\\. Add milk, cream, and bouillon. Cook until the mixture thickens to the desired consistency. Turn heat to low and add chicken and peas and cook until thoroughly heated. Season with salt & pepper.  \n  \n4\\. Pour mixture into a 9 x 13 and pop the puff pastry lattice on top. Brush with a beaten egg and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving (this allows it to thicken up again and prevents you from burning your mouth).  \n  \n  \n\\*You can cook the chicken any way you like. Sometimes I cook it in the crockpot and shred it. Other times, I cook it on the stove and chop it. Anything works! I season with Emeril's Essence.  \n  \n\\*\\*\\*This method makes it way easier to pop the lattice on the pie and throw it in the oven. You can make the lattice right on the pot pie, but the puff pastry starts to get kind of melty.  \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2G_gbOoVT6w/V36SJoLAKDI/AAAAAAAACNs/eNP8Ee917AMVO2KZ7dpYBLVZiOrBTmrTwCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-07%2Bat%2B11.23.13%2BAM.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2G_gbOoVT6w/V36SJoLAKDI/AAAAAAAACNs/eNP8Ee917AMVO2KZ7dpYBLVZiOrBTmrTwCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-07%2Bat%2B11.23.13%2BAM.png)  \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e8GmMBZiXW4/V36SHnnqUvI/AAAAAAAACNs/9RNxlvONfwcxVjt2BGirhmu3uYgR9sVuACKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-07%2Bat%2B11.23.03%2BAM.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e8GmMBZiXW4/V36SHnnqUvI/AAAAAAAACNs/9RNxlvONfwcxVjt2BGirhmu3uYgR9sVuACKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-07%2Bat%2B11.23.03%2BAM.png)"

Combine warm water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let the yeast activate for 5 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. To the yeast, add warm milk, sugar, salt, egg, butter, and 1 cup flour. Stir to combine. Slowly add the remaining flour, until the dough is mixed. I always take out the dough to knead by hand for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to make sure the dough is smooth. Let rise in a covered, greased bowl in a warm place until doubled in size.   \n    \n3. Cut a piece of parchment paper into 4\" squares. Roll dough out on a floured surface until just over 1/2\" thick. Cut into circles with a 2\" cutter. Sprinkle flour onto parchment square before placing each donut on a square. Let rise, covered, until nearly doubled.   \n    \n4\\. Heat oil to 350 degrees fahrenheit in a heavy-bottomed pan or fryer. Fry 2-3 donuts at a time, 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Remove and let sit for 1-2 minutes on a paper-towel lined drying rack. Then, throw the donuts around in a bag with sugar until coated.   \n    \n5\\. Put jam into a freezer bag with the corner cut off or decorating bag with a round tip. Use a chopstick to poke a hole in the side of each donut, then fill with jam.   \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CVB3dI4hAAQ/V3QY6ZPVMkI/AAAAAAAACMY/ra8RjbEekUYcaP3pqhZ282AxcRIYdC-kgCKgB/s640/P1015783.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CVB3dI4hAAQ/V3QY6ZPVMkI/AAAAAAAACMY/ra8RjbEekUYcaP3pqhZ282AxcRIYdC-kgCKgB/s1600/P1015783.jpg)"

Surprisingly, I've only posted _one_ recipe involving peanut butter in the 4 years I've had my blog.  \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Tozh85iuQlo/V2yZaWiUTKI/AAAAAAAACK8/JhPrMVhrLBIvwVtlCZH3SmByG6R_Zym9ACKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.06.08%2BPM.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Tozh85iuQlo/V2yZaWiUTKI/AAAAAAAACK8/JhPrMVhrLBIvwVtlCZH3SmByG6R_Zym9ACKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.06.08%2BPM.png)  \n  \nIt's probably because I chow down on anything with peanut butter before I can photograph it.    \n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sYAMJg5t1Ak/V2yZW9VUVyI/AAAAAAAACK8/DWugtFn0am0CvolCqa0RekDQbzzwaVM5wCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.11%2BPM.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sYAMJg5t1Ak/V2yZW9VUVyI/AAAAAAAACK8/DWugtFn0am0CvolCqa0RekDQbzzwaVM5wCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.11%2BPM.png)  \n  \nI'm the type of person who buys whatever brand of stuff is the cheapest at the store. I'm no snob when it comes to the generic labels! Luckily, my absolute favorite brand of peanut butter (and the only kind I'll buy) is the Kroger brand, which is the store brand where I shop. Is there anything you'll only buy in a specific brand?  \n    \n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mr18NbLSptc/V2yZY5MfE1I/AAAAAAAACK8/FFpNIiPFct49GffKEKbllLq5YBrZsKo3ACKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.48%2BPM.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mr18NbLSptc/V2yZY5MfE1I/AAAAAAAACK8/FFpNIiPFct49GffKEKbllLq5YBrZsKo3ACKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.48%2BPM.png)  \n  \nThis recipe is a variation on the famous New York Times Cookie recipe.

Mix together flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside.  \n  \n2\\. Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat. Slowly add the dry ingredients until it is just incorporated.  \n  \n3\\. Fold in the peanut butter cups and chips. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.  \n  \n 4. Scoop 2 oz balls (these are big cookies-- the dough should be at least 2\" in diameter) onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment or silpat. I only baked 6 cookies at a time-- they're that big! Sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 350 for 13-18 minutes, depending on the size of your cookies. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the middles no longer look raw.  \n  \n\\* You can use whatever ratio of the two flours you have-- I was about 1/2 cup short on the cake flour, so I used AP flour for that 1/2 cup. Just make sure you have 17 oz flour altogether.  \n  \n\\*\\*\\* I got mini peanut butter cups at Winco in the bulk section. They're adorable and perfect for baking! They work great in cookies, brownies, and ice cream.  \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Lw8UWmP6760/V2yZboWlp3I/AAAAAAAACK8/rWeaqVldLUYBK-jR581Ru6ApYrPQQCALgCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.06.30%2BPM.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Lw8UWmP6760/V2yZboWlp3I/AAAAAAAACK8/rWeaqVldLUYBK-jR581Ru6ApYrPQQCALgCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.06.30%2BPM.png)  \n    \n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81oXowoGSTY/V2yZX3Z3a4I/AAAAAAAACK8/rkBzd2NBipofOkJ9dHpSbgsYTTNanTrwQCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.30%2BPM.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81oXowoGSTY/V2yZX3Z3a4I/AAAAAAAACK8/rkBzd2NBipofOkJ9dHpSbgsYTTNanTrwQCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.30%2BPM.png)  \n    \n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX3JYVTmiLg/V2yZZa7IyUI/AAAAAAAACK8/FyoU-JByfqY9ZR4yGcD5htIzrmEd_2mgQCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.57%2BPM.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xX3JYVTmiLg/V2yZZa7IyUI/AAAAAAAACK8/FyoU-JByfqY9ZR4yGcD5htIzrmEd_2mgQCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-23%2Bat%2B8.05.57%2BPM.png)"

My love of puff pastry first started in a French-style cafe my family visited often when I was growing up.  \n    \n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EfjdWdubxYI/V2ByJmegy-I/AAAAAAAACFI/azbXDxtWL_gd2rflqyTHnr6f5KRDloE3ACKgB/s640/P1015087.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EfjdWdubxYI/V2ByJmegy-I/AAAAAAAACFI/azbXDxtWL_gd2rflqyTHnr6f5KRDloE3ACKgB/s1600/P1015087.jpg)  \n  \n  \nThey have a dish called a chicken friand. It's a mixture of french cheese, mushrooms, and chicken stuffed into a puff pastry shell. It was the first \"fancy\" food I ate, and the first \"fancy\" dish I learned to cook by myself. Recipe coming soon (once I can muster up the self-control to put off eating the chicken friands long enough to photograph them).  \n    \n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g8s1o6Yq8sU/V2ByL-53x5I/AAAAAAAACFI/0ySJLzD7dmsR2DWtiLEpRPKmOc7A6-xhwCKgB/s640/P1015095.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g8s1o6Yq8sU/V2ByL-53x5I/AAAAAAAACFI/0ySJLzD7dmsR2DWtiLEpRPKmOc7A6-xhwCKgB/s1600/P1015095.jpg)  \n  \n  \nThis mushroom tart is reminiscent of the chicken friand, except this tart can be on the table in just a half hour. It's really versatile-- it can work as an appetizer, side, or entrée (or a dessert, if you're really strange).  \n    \n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAwbNgbPBR0/V2ByLVIjd8I/AAAAAAAACFI/Tx4JslTJVGExC69cZgCuSROWbyKARURFQCKgB/s640/P1015106.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAwbNgbPBR0/V2ByLVIjd8I/AAAAAAAACFI/Tx4JslTJVGExC69cZgCuSROWbyKARURFQCKgB/s1600/P1015106.jpg)  \n  \nOne of the best parts of this recipe is that you can substitute pretty much any of the ingredients. I've made it with tons of different things, and it's always come out beautifully.  \n    \n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SiBkRwGMPp8/V2ByNTjsthI/AAAAAAAACFI/0csmO3E3z3Uu2mV9GvBlaFXVyzYsR47RQCKgB/s640/P1015115.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SiBkRwGMPp8/V2ByNTjsthI/AAAAAAAACFI/0csmO3E3z3Uu2mV9GvBlaFXVyzYsR47RQCKgB/s1600/P1015115.jpg)  \n    \nMushroom Tart\n-------------  \nYields: two 9\" tarts (Serves 4 entrees or up to 12 as a side or an appetizer)  \n  \n1 sheet puff pastry  \n3 slices bacon  \n1 tsp minced garlic  \n2 cups sliced mushrooms  \n2 tsp Emeril's Essence\\*  \n3 tbsp water  \n1/4 cup shredded gruyère (or swiss, or parmesan)  \n1/2 cup sour cream (or cream cheese)  \n1 egg, beaten  \n  \n  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut puff pastry in half. Place on a cookie sheet lined with Silpat or parchment.  \n  \n2\\. Cook bacon. Remove from pan, but leave the bacon grease in the pan. Sauté the garlic in the bacon grease for 1 minute, then add mushrooms, reserving about 10 slices to decorate the tart. Add Emeril's Essence. Cook until the mushrooms release all their liquid. Add water as necessary to prevent burning or sticking.  \n  \n3\\. Remove from heat and add crumbled bacon, gruyère, and sour cream.\\*\\* Spread on the puff pastry. Top with reserved mushrooms. Brush the edges with beaten egg and bake for 15-20 minutes.  \n  \n  \n\\*Emeril's Essence is my go-to seasoning. I use it on everything!! You can also substitute this with your preferred seasoning.  \n  \n\\*\\*You can make the mixture ahead of time and refrigerate. It will keep for a day or two."

I just bought one for myself, and this was my first time using it. It works way better than a knife for me, so if you make bread frequently, I would recommend getting one! Here's the one I bought.   \n    \n    \nThe original recipe makes 2 large loaves, but I make 8 sandwich loaves. You can size and shape the loaves however you like. Recipe adapted from [Naomi Cakes](http://naomi-sugarspice.blogspot.ca/2013/01/easy-french-bread-recipe.html).   \n    \nSandwich Bread Loaves\n---------------------  \nYields: 2-10 loaves, depending on the size   \n    \n1/2 cup warm water  \n1/2 tsp sugar  \n1 tbsp yeast (or 1 packet yeast)  \n2 cups warm water  \n2 tbsp sugar  \n2 tsp salt  \n2 tbsp oil   \n5 + cups flour (more if needed, depending on your humidity and temperature)  \n1 egg with a splash of cold water for egg wash  \n    \n1\\. Combine 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp sugar, and yeast. Stir until dissolved and let activate for 10 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. While the yeast is activating, mix together the remaining water, sugar, salt, and oil in large bowl (I use my Kitchenaid). Stir to combine. Add the yeast mixture and 2 cups flour and mix.   \n    \n3\\. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough starts to remove from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the mixer or by hand until the dough slightly springs back when you press your finger into it. Let rise, covered, in a greased bowl until it's doubled in size.   \n    \n4\\. Punch down dough and shape into the desired shape. Let rise for 30-40 minutes, until puffy. Score the dough with a sharp knife and brush the loaves with an egg wash.   \n    \n5\\. Bake at 375 degrees until the loaves sound hollow when tapped. For the smaller sandwich loaves, it takes about 20 minutes. Larger loaves will probably take 30-40 minutes.   \n    \n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--wabyLpEaTg/V0cuPXVJ_2I/AAAAAAAACDo/PvBBAComMC0BYGeqD5MlRhipGX1EkaPBwCKgB/s640/P1014731.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--wabyLpEaTg/V0cuPXVJ_2I/AAAAAAAACDo/PvBBAComMC0BYGeqD5MlRhipGX1EkaPBwCKgB/s1600/P1014731.jpg)  \n    \n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pl-CbMaiJP8/V0cuQlHY-lI/AAAAAAAACDo/RgTpc4-zU2w7ljK1ytxIqBy-wslAbVhxQCKgB/s640/P1014740.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pl-CbMaiJP8/V0cuQlHY-lI/AAAAAAAACDo/RgTpc4-zU2w7ljK1ytxIqBy-wslAbVhxQCKgB/s1600/P1014740.jpg)"

Sounds like an impossible concept, right? How on earth could anyone ever have leftover brownies?  \n    \n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAwTnw8TFo0/VteT1ICTWGI/AAAAAAAAB7A/qsvytFskV-0/s640/P1014597.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAwTnw8TFo0/VteT1ICTWGI/AAAAAAAAB7A/qsvytFskV-0/s1600/P1014597.jpg)  \n    \nBefore you think I'm too crazy, I didn't actually have leftover brownies. I made a 9 x 13 pan of brownies for me and Austin last week, and after 24 hours, there were 2 brownies left.   \n    \n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EUz_h7IxRAA/VteTrqxp9nI/AAAAAAAAB7E/j5PRoJNOp8o/s640/P1014586.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EUz_h7IxRAA/VteTrqxp9nI/AAAAAAAAB7E/j5PRoJNOp8o/s1600/P1014586.jpg)  \n    \nTechnically, I guess that means we had leftover brownies. But with only 2 people eating 80% of a 9 x 13 pan of brownies in less than a day, I'm not sure if I'd count that as \"leftovers.\"  \n    \nWhen I saw a recipe for brownie chunk chocolate chip cookies on Pinterest, I knew I had to try it out with our two \"leftover\" brownies.   \n    \n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2DIjkX12ZcY/VteTynKQZOI/AAAAAAAAB7E/fYA4xES2T30/s640/P1014595.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2DIjkX12ZcY/VteTynKQZOI/AAAAAAAAB7E/fYA4xES2T30/s1600/P1014595.jpg)  \n    \nMan, am I glad I did!! These are INSANE. They're the perfect combination of brownies and cookies.   \n    \nSince I'm pretty sure leftover brownies are a myth, you might have to actually make the brownies to go with the cookies. But it's worth it. Totally worth it. Recipe adapted from [Two Peas and Their Pod](http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/chocolate-chip-brownie-cookies/).  \n    \nBrownie Chunk Chocolate Chip Cookies\n------------------------------------  \nYields: 24 cookies  \n  \n1 1/2 cups flour  \n3/4 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1/2 cup butter, softened  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n3/4 cup brown sugar  \n1 egg  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n3/4 cup chocolate chips  \n3/4 cup brownie chunks  \n  \n1\\.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. Grease and flour a cookie sheet. \n2.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. \n3.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla. \n4.  In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, then add the lemon zest. \n5.  Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients, to the butter mixture. Mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 15-22 minutes, until set. \n6.  Mix together the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and buttermilk to make the glaze (it will be thick). Pour on the hot cake and spread it on the cake. Immediately sprinkle the sugar on top of the glaze. Slice with a plastic spatula or knife and enjoy!   \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GSlvWRCPNMM/Vq1QmYbnNfI/AAAAAAAAB4c/TcQ2WGmTuhU/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-01-30%2Bat%2B5.05.36%2BPM.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GSlvWRCPNMM/Vq1QmYbnNfI/AAAAAAAAB4c/TcQ2WGmTuhU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-01-30%2Bat%2B5.05.36%2BPM.png)"

Using a mixer, cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated.   \n    \n2\\. Add the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined. Divide the dough in half and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.   \n    \n3\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut out into desired shapes. Bake for 10-12 minutes on a lined baking sheet (I line it with my silpat, but you can use parchment paper).   \n    \n4\\. Let cool on a cooling rack and make the filling. Beat the butter for 30 seconds on medium, then add the vanilla. Add the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, then add the cream as necessary to thin it to the desired consistency.   \n    \n5\\. Fill and serve. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hQVK3jmNJlo/VfJDu3DhXiI/AAAAAAAABuU/8391FVhUm8M/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-10%2Bat%2B6.59.54%2BPM.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hQVK3jmNJlo/VfJDu3DhXiI/AAAAAAAABuU/8391FVhUm8M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-10%2Bat%2B6.59.54%2BPM.png)"

The white bread is delicious, but have you tried the brown bread???   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iVO8l2foDpY/VdJgJhvmKCI/AAAAAAAABtM/sesObuYVtPo/s640/P1014106.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iVO8l2foDpY/VdJgJhvmKCI/AAAAAAAABtM/sesObuYVtPo/s1600/P1014106.jpg)  \n    \nIt's life-changing. Apparently it's called \"honey wheat black (or black) bread,\" but I just call it the brown bread. I've wanted to try a recipe for this bread for a long time, but I could never find a good one that seemed reliable.  \n  \nSo I looked through different recipes to create my own. I gathered ideas from various recipes.  \n  \nFriends, this bread is a home run. It tastes EXACTLY like the bread from the restaurant. _EXACTLY_ LIKE IT!! Get out your mixers, because you're going to want to make this right now.  \n    \nCopycat Cheesecake Factory Honey Wheat Bread\n--------------------------------------------  \nYields: 5-6 small loaves  \n  \n1 1/2 cups warm water  \n1 tbsp sugar  \n1 tbsp instant dry yeast  \n2 1/2 cups bread flour  \n2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour  \n1 tbsp cocoa powder  \n1 tsp salt  \n3 tbsp butter, softened  \n3 tbsp molasses  \n1/4 cup honey  \noats for decoration  \n  \n1\\. In a medium bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir until combined and let it sit for 5 minutes to activate.  \n  \n2\\. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 2 cups bread flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Stir to combine.  \n  \n3\\. Pour the yeast mixture into the dry ingredients and add the butter, molasses, and honey. Stir to roughly combine, then attach the dough hook. Add more flour if needed (the dough should not stick to the sides or bottom of the bowl). Knead on medium-low speed for 8-10 minutes, or until it passes the fingerprint test (meaning, when you poke it with your finger, it should bounce back slowly.)  \n  \n4\\. Let dough rise in a covered greased bowl in a warm place until doubled. Mine took about 30 minutes because I put it in a 100 degree oven.  \n  \n5\\. Divide the dough and form it into the desired shapes. Spray the tops with water and sprinkle oats, if desired. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and cover the loaves with it, then let them rise until doubled.  \n  \n6\\. Bake at 350 for 25-35 minutes, depending on the shape. Loaves are done when they sound hollow when you tap on them.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5xzBtoJxys/VdJgJM5-xNI/AAAAAAAABtE/tLax84_If7E/s640/P1014102.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5xzBtoJxys/VdJgJM5-xNI/AAAAAAAABtE/tLax84_If7E/s1600/P1014102.jpg)"

It's a simple vanilla bundt cake soaked with a butter glaze throughout the entire cake. The glaze goes on while the cake is cooling in the pan, and it creates a moist soaked cake with a slightly sugar crisp on the outside of the cake.    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mEAux9ledC0/VY8kiSthfBI/AAAAAAAABqA/AQD8sNp0Kww/s640/11651305_10205728005814146_1754271085_n.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mEAux9ledC0/VY8kiSthfBI/AAAAAAAABqA/AQD8sNp0Kww/s1600/11651305_10205728005814146_1754271085_n.jpg)  \n    \nBundt cakes have frustrated me in the past, because parts always seem to stick in the pan. I can't stand that! For this recipe, the cake didn't stick at all. The secret?  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xKPR6_Gxj98/VZB_yO9sM-I/AAAAAAAABrk/3PmDSZUQoQY/s640/P1014029.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xKPR6_Gxj98/VZB_yO9sM-I/AAAAAAAABrk/3PmDSZUQoQY/s1600/P1014029.JPG)  \n    \nYou have to let the bundt cool **all the way** in the pan before inverting it.   \n    \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OnXZNKD7mKc/VZB_Kh6XFOI/AAAAAAAABrQ/l9vqJ-Z4qJc/s640/P1014003.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OnXZNKD7mKc/VZB_Kh6XFOI/AAAAAAAABrQ/l9vqJ-Z4qJc/s1600/P1014003.JPG)  \n    \n    \nThis cake is great, because it's even better on the second and third days. This means you can **make it the night before**, and it will be even more moist the next day! This cake will still be great if you can't resist it on the first day, but I recommend waiting if you can!   \n    \nKentucky Butter Bundt\n---------------------  \nYields: approximately 12 servings   \n    \n**Cake**  \n1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  \n2 cups sugar  \n4 eggs  \n1 tbsp vanilla  \n3 cups flour  \n1 tsp salt  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1 cup buttermilk  \n    \n**Glaze**  \n1/3 cup butter  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n2 tbsp water  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. Grease a bundt pan liberally with butter or shortening, getting into every nook and cranny. Lightly sprinkle with flour and tap out the excess.  \n2\\. Place all the cake ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a bowl with a hand mixer). Mix on low for 30 seconds, then up to medium (about a 4) for 3 minutes.   \n    \n3\\. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 55-75 minutes (it totally depends on your oven and altitude), or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.   \n    \n4\\. Prepare the glaze by combining all of the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low. Stir until everything melts and dissolves together, but make sure you don't boil it.   \n    \n5\\. Right when the cake comes out of the oven, poke holes in it with a knife. **Keep the cake in the pan**! Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, letting it soak in as you go.   \n    \n6\\. Let the cake cool completely (I covered it and left it overnight) before inverting. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.   \n    \n**Note**: Cake is best if you make it the day before so it can cool in the pan overnight.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3bc69hEz0Q4/VZB_IbyZErI/AAAAAAAABrI/RHCwEP6YxMY/s640/P1013997.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3bc69hEz0Q4/VZB_IbyZErI/AAAAAAAABrI/RHCwEP6YxMY/s1600/P1013997.JPG)"

There are two options for the recipe: **you can make the dough the night before, or you can make it the day you want to fry them**.   \n    \nThe sugar on the outside gives them the perfect sweet crunch, and the whipped pastry cream adds a delectable rich filling without being overly sweet.   \n    \nCream-Filled Donuts\n-------------------  \nYields: 12 donuts  \nTime: 2 hours (or overnight)  \n    \n**Donuts:**  \n1 tbsp active dry yeast  \n2/3 cup milk, warm  \n3 1/2 cups flour  \n1/3 cup sugar  \n2 tsp salt  \n3 eggs  \n7 tbsp butter, softened and cut into cubes  \n    \n**Pastry Cream:**  \n1 1/2 cups whole milk  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n3-4 tbsp flour  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n4 egg yolks  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n6 tbsp heavy cream  \n    \nOil for frying (enough to go 3 inches up the side of your pan)  \n    \n1 cup sugar for coating  \n    \n1\\. Combine milk, yeast, and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes to activate. Add flour, sugar, salt, and eggs. Using a dough hook, mix until combined, about 3 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. Add the butter, a little bit at a time, and knead (in the mixer, if you want) for 5-6 minutes, or until combined. At this point, you can wrap the dough and let it sit overnight. If you want the donuts sooner, let the dough rise, covered, in an oiled bowl in a warm place. Let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. (I turn on my oven and put the dough bowl on top of the oven to get some heat).   \n    \n3\\. Make the pastry cream: Put the milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. While it's heating, combine sugar, flour, salt, and egg yolks until thoroughly combined. Once the milk is simmering but not boiling, remove the milk from the heat and spoon a few tablespoons into the egg yolk mixture while stirring. Continue to add the milk slowly. Once it's all been added, return it to the saucepan. Cook until it comes up to a boil and reaches the desired consistency. Add the vanilla and refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap.   \n    \n4\\. Roll out the risen donut dough and cut into 3\" circles. Place on a greased cookie sheet, cover, and let them rise in a warm place until almost doubled in height. They will be pillowy when they're ready.  \n    \n5\\. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees fahrenheit. Put the coating sugar in a shallow bowl to dip the donuts after they're fried. Use a spatula to get the donuts off of the cookie sheet into the oil. I did them one at a time. Flip after 2 minutes or so. Place the donuts on a paper towel-lined plate.   \n    \n6\\. Once the donuts are still hot but cool enough to handle, dip them in the sugar and place on a cooling rack. I would have one in the oil at all times, and while another was cooking I would dip another in sugar. Don't let them cool too much or the sugar won't stick well.   \n    \n7\\. Whip the cream until very stiff. Combine it with the cooled pastry cream. Poke a hole in the donuts with a chopstick and fill using a pastry bag and a round tip (or a bag with the corner cut off).   \n    \nThey're best the same day (but definitely still tasty on day two).   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyxiXqtL1Zw/VVgB6h5VkOI/AAAAAAAABjY/c059x3lyBrA/s640/P1013844.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyxiXqtL1Zw/VVgB6h5VkOI/AAAAAAAABjY/c059x3lyBrA/s1600/P1013844.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OHWZ4Cxg1fc/VVgCDADwn_I/AAAAAAAABjo/ta_cbcj4lJ0/s640/P1013845.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OHWZ4Cxg1fc/VVgCDADwn_I/AAAAAAAABjo/ta_cbcj4lJ0/s1600/P1013845.JPG)"

They have so much frosting and so many sprinkles that after a few bites, I have to stop eating.   \n    \nAfter you take just a few bites of those iconic cookies, you're left with that delightful (ha) aftertaste that's reminiscent of... well, nail polish remover.

Basically, you cream the butter and sugar. Add a few more ingredients, then add the dry ingredients. Then, I let it cool in the fridge for a few minutes while I prepare my pans, cutters, and frosting. Then, I cut them out on a floured surface and bake. Frost and top with sprinkles, and you have yourself a perfect cookie!   \n    \nSoft Sugar Cookies\n------------------  \nYields: 2-3 dozen (depending on the size)   \n    \n1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  \n1 cup sugar  \n1 egg   \n1 tsp vanilla  \n2 tbsp milk or cream  \n3 cups flour  \n1 1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n    \n1\\. Cream together butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes on high. Add egg, vanilla, and milk and incorporate well.  \n    \n2\\. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add slowly to the wet ingredients, mixing well as you go. Cover and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.   \n    \n3\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Roll out the dough about 1/4\" thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out in desired shapes and move onto a silpat-lined or parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, depending on your preference. (I liked them at 8 minutes because I love them really soft.)  \n    \nButtercream Frosting\n--------------------  \n2/3 cup butter, softened  \n3 cups powdered sugar  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n2 tbsp cream  \nfood coloring if desired  \n    \nBeat the butter, then add the powdered sugar little by little. Finish with the vanilla and cream, then add food coloring if desired.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sdDPNWD3xak/VU6SI-uNOBI/AAAAAAAABhM/jZf8tIiLUtc/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-09%2Bat%2B4.51.34%2BPM.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sdDPNWD3xak/VU6SI-uNOBI/AAAAAAAABhM/jZf8tIiLUtc/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-09%2Bat%2B4.51.34%2BPM.png)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hKlII5OUWDA/VU6SJApViNI/AAAAAAAABhQ/Be0hCTtjO9s/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-07%2Bat%2B10.07.51%2BAM.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hKlII5OUWDA/VU6SJApViNI/AAAAAAAABhQ/Be0hCTtjO9s/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-07%2Bat%2B10.07.51%2BAM.png)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vKsaaOkujOk/VU6SKj1gpOI/AAAAAAAABhc/vMLf8eMPCJw/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-09%2Bat%2B5.00.37%2BPM.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vKsaaOkujOk/VU6SKj1gpOI/AAAAAAAABhc/vMLf8eMPCJw/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-09%2Bat%2B5.00.37%2BPM.png)"

Blueberry cinnamon toast crunch muffins. You read that right. Sounds a little odd, n'est-ce pas?  \n  \nOn Saturday afternoon, I was browsing Pinterest. Summer is quickly approaching, so everyone is currently pinning delicious summery foods.  \n  \n I found myself pinning blueberry recipe after blueberry recipe, and my mouth began to water. Blueberries are my favorite berry, so I buy them in bulk at Sam's and usually eat the whole container by myself in less than a day.  \n  \nWell, it just so happened that I had some blueberries in the fridge because I had bought them the day before (already mostly gone). I got to thinking about what would go well with blueberries and I decided cinnamon would be yummy.  \n  \nThen, I had an epiphany. Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  \n  \nI like for my muffins to have a little crunch on top (similar to a streusel). These muffins are so good. I can hardly describe how excited I was when they came out of the oven. Experimenting with recipes can be tricky, but these turned out on the first try!  \n  \nThese muffins are full of blueberries, super moist, and have a delightful crunch on the top where the Cinnamon Toast Crunch is.  \n  \nGeneral Mills really should be paying me for this. Why aren't they?  \n    \nBlueberry Cinnamon Toast Crunch Muffins\n---------------------------------------  \nYields: 15-18 muffins  \n  \n2 cups flour  \n1 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp baking powder  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1/4 tsp cinnamon  \n2 eggs  \n1 cup milk  \n1/4 cup vegetable oil  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 cup fresh blueberries  \n1/2 cup Cinnamon Toast Crunch  \n1 tbsp butter, melted  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Line a muffin tin with muffin papers. Crush the Cinnamon Toast Crunch in a food processor or in a bag using a rolling pin.  \n  \n2\\. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon) with a whisk.  \n  \n3\\. In a medium bowl, combine wet ingredients (eggs, milk, oil, vanilla). Pour into the dry ingredients and stir with a silicone spatula until just combined, but still lumpy. Fold in the blueberries. Fold in half of the crushed cereal.  \n  \n4\\. Scoop the muffin batter evenly into the liners, until about 3/4 full. Combine the remaining crushed cereal and the melted butter. Sprinkle atop the muffins and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.  \n    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lzzeredfSB8/VUbgi3Zor6I/AAAAAAAABZk/8ifZ_I1KkqI/s1600/P1013583.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lzzeredfSB8/VUbgi3Zor6I/AAAAAAAABZk/8ifZ_I1KkqI/s1600/P1013583.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WDKhQN8Vo18/VUbhGMA2s7I/AAAAAAAABaE/HTJHxq3G7-4/s1600/P1013638.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WDKhQN8Vo18/VUbhGMA2s7I/AAAAAAAABaE/HTJHxq3G7-4/s1600/P1013638.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Xf6c0bPJwU/VUbhEzHDcuI/AAAAAAAABZ8/zVontkLbX6c/s1600/P1013597.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Xf6c0bPJwU/VUbhEzHDcuI/AAAAAAAABZ8/zVontkLbX6c/s1600/P1013597.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lTTTHg2cJkk/VUbhDETpRJI/AAAAAAAABZ0/tEncdwUtClc/s1600/P1013606.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lTTTHg2cJkk/VUbhDETpRJI/AAAAAAAABZ0/tEncdwUtClc/s1600/P1013606.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XOz6X53AfWY/VUbg_vlnnPI/AAAAAAAABZs/_3UH0ZKmgQA/s1600/P1013614.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XOz6X53AfWY/VUbg_vlnnPI/AAAAAAAABZs/_3UH0ZKmgQA/s1600/P1013614.JPG)"

One is floral design, where I will get to... well, design floral arrangements. The other is a cooking class. I had a full scholarship, and there were no classes I needed to take, so I figured I would take a couple fun classes.  \n  \nWell, one of my classes was canceled a few days ago, so during my free time I decided to do something with my browning bananas. I hate wasting food.  \n  \nI found a recipe for banana bread muffins that looked good, so I decided to try it.  \n  \nI was mistaken. The recipe isn't good. The recipe is AWESOME.  \n  \nThese muffins are the perfect banana bread consistency and texture. I brought some of the extras to work and left them in the break room. Every single person who ate one walked out and said, \"These are SO GOOD. Who made these?!?!?\"  \n  \nMission accomplished, I'd say.  \n    \nBanana Bread Muffins\n--------------------  \nYields: 12 muffins  \n  \n2 cups (10 oz) flour  \n3/4 cup (5 oz) sugar  \n3/4 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n3 overly ripe medium bananas  \n1/4 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt)  \n2 eggs  \n6 tbsp vegetable oil  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n  \n1\\.

Scoop the batter evenly into 12 muffin liners and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.  \n  \nTips:  \n    \n*   Use a cookie scoop to evenly distribute the muffin batter\n*   Remove muffins from the muffin tin within 5 minutes of removing it from the oven. If you let them cool in the muffin tin, the papers might peel away from the muffins after they cool.   \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I3s1eknnQX4/VUGrLfefqVI/AAAAAAAABWY/8tDQo-W8dK0/s1600/P1013541.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I3s1eknnQX4/VUGrLfefqVI/AAAAAAAABWY/8tDQo-W8dK0/s1600/P1013541.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IDj3_xjv4ys/VUGrMUTVyJI/AAAAAAAABWg/jGgStRFqidI/s1600/P1013544.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IDj3_xjv4ys/VUGrMUTVyJI/AAAAAAAABWg/jGgStRFqidI/s1600/P1013544.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-874Ahu8d8lk/VUGrh1sklnI/AAAAAAAABWw/AnllAmJP5dU/s1600/P1013549.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-874Ahu8d8lk/VUGrh1sklnI/AAAAAAAABWw/AnllAmJP5dU/s1600/P1013549.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LizWsT9ep_E/VUGrj2sMLUI/AAAAAAAABW4/DrwB4JjyLp0/s1600/P1013553.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LizWsT9ep_E/VUGrj2sMLUI/AAAAAAAABW4/DrwB4JjyLp0/s1600/P1013553.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fdA45iVp918/VUGrl85koaI/AAAAAAAABXA/A97yyG4ZcO0/s1600/P1013570.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fdA45iVp918/VUGrl85koaI/AAAAAAAABXA/A97yyG4ZcO0/s1600/P1013570.JPG)"

I keep accidentally calling this recipe Brownie Cheesecake, but it's definitely Cheesecake Brownies.  \n  \nYou see, in this situation, \"cheesecake\" is the adjective to describe the type of brownies (instead of \"brownie\" being the adjective to describe the type of cheesecake).  \n  \nHave a mentioned lately that I'm a big nerd?  \n  \nAnyway, I sent these cheesecake brownies to my sister in honor of... well, nothing. Just because. Because of this, I only got to eat one of these delicious jewels before I had to put them in a box to be shipped off to San Francisco (a fact over which I lamented as I edited the photos on this post).  \n  \nRecipe adapted from [Yammie's Noshery](http://www.yammiesnoshery.com/2014/03/cheesecake-swirl-brownies.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed:+YammiesNoshery+(Yammie%27s+Noshery)).  \n    \nCheesecake Brownies\n-------------------  \nYields: 15 brownies  \n  \nBrownies:  \n1 cup (2 sticks) butter  \n2 cups sugar  \n4 eggs  \n1 tbsp vanilla  \n1 1/4 cups cocoa powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1 1/2 cups flour  \n1 cup chocolate chips  \n  \nCheesecake:  \n8 oz cream cheese, softened  \n1/4 cup sour cream  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n1/2 tsp vanilla  \n1 egg  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease a 9x13\" baking dish and set aside.  \n  \n2\\. Put butter and sugar in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1-2 minutes, or until melted. Stir to incorporate. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool.  \n  \n3\\. Add the butter/sugar to the bowl of a mixer and beat for 1 minute. Add eggs and vanilla and mix. Combine dry ingredients (not including chocolate chips) in a separate bowl and add the mixture slowly to the wet ingredients. Pour into the prepared pan.  \n  \n4\\. Combine all of the cheesecake ingredients in a separate bowl and beat until smooth. Pour in dollops atop the brownie batter in the prepared pan and swirl around using a knife.  \n  \n5\\. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes, or until desired consistency is achieved.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVQOXy4IbDo/VTGcWlaoCPI/AAAAAAAABVQ/BT1hVWuvoho/s1600/P1013514.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVQOXy4IbDo/VTGcWlaoCPI/AAAAAAAABVQ/BT1hVWuvoho/s1600/P1013514.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-erSyj5MY-Ss/VTGcTU3eSzI/AAAAAAAABVI/8ebHZN55ME4/s1600/P1013501.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-erSyj5MY-Ss/VTGcTU3eSzI/AAAAAAAABVI/8ebHZN55ME4/s1600/P1013501.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OzjtGL13174/VTGcW6tji6I/AAAAAAAABVU/nK2MBNCBuSo/s1600/P1013488.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OzjtGL13174/VTGcW6tji6I/AAAAAAAABVU/nK2MBNCBuSo/s1600/P1013488.JPG)  \n    \nYou may also like [Brownie Cheesecake:](/2014/04/brownie-cheesecake.html)   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UWxZY7AfXjM/VTGtGmUbbDI/AAAAAAAABVo/ueZLwXtBSXE/s1600/P1011264.JPG)](/2014/04/brownie-cheesecake.html)"

I just felt like I couldn't leave off any part of it! I'm not sure which descriptor I like the best:  \n    \n**One Bowl**: simple clean up (though I must admit the one bowl I used when making these is still \"soaking\" in the sink... we all know \"soaking\" is just code for _I'm too tired to do the dishes_, right?)   \n    \n**Double Chocolate**: You can't go wrong here. Anything that has cocoa powder AND chocolate chips has to be good, right?   \n    \n**Banana**: You can read my ode to bananas [by clicking here](/2013/07/banana-cream-cheese-muffins.html).   \n    \n**Muffins**: Pretty much cake wrapped up in a convenient package (muffin paper) that makes it seem \"healthier.\" People might judge you for eating cake for breakfast (we don't befriend those people), but no one will ever judge you for eating a muffin for breakfast!   \n    \nI've posted this recipe before, but this time I've tweaked it to perfect it and updated the pictures!   \n###     \n### One Bowl Double Chocolate Banana Muffins  \nYields 12 muffins  \n  \n1 cup overly ripe bananas (about 2 medium-large bananas)  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 egg  \n1/2 cup veggie or canola oil  \n1/3 cup milk  \n2/3 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp brown sugar  \n2 tbsp unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 1/4 tsp baking soda  \n1 2/3 cups flour  \n1/3 cup mini chocolate chips   \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Line a muffin pan with 12 muffin liners.  \n  \n2\\. In a large bowl, mash bananas (I used a potato masher). Add vanilla and egg. Stir well. Add oil and milk and stir well.  \n  \n2\\. Add sugars and mix well, then add cocoa powder and stir well. The cocoa powder doesn't incorporate as easily, so you may have to do some extra stirring.  \n  \n3\\. Add salt and baking soda. Mix well. Add flour and stir until just incorporated.  \n  \n4\\. Add about half of the chocolate chips to the batter and reserve the rest. Scoop the muffin batter with a cookie scoop into the liners, about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the muffin batter.  \n  \n5\\. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  \n  \nThey're great warm or at room temperature!  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n1QbxOhxZF4/VSYTor1dUxI/AAAAAAAABTA/v7U4DevNd80/s1600/P1013394.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n1QbxOhxZF4/VSYTor1dUxI/AAAAAAAABTA/v7U4DevNd80/s1600/P1013394.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lwEr1hAVmr0/VSYTp_ZzJqI/AAAAAAAABTI/-MQ2uKlXex0/s1600/P1013427.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lwEr1hAVmr0/VSYTp_ZzJqI/AAAAAAAABTI/-MQ2uKlXex0/s1600/P1013427.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hf2VG9gANc/VSYTqaanzAI/AAAAAAAABTM/LHvDXaYWXD0/s1600/P1013429.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hf2VG9gANc/VSYTqaanzAI/AAAAAAAABTM/LHvDXaYWXD0/s1600/P1013429.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4RCTbd6PNaI/VSYT3BtvURI/AAAAAAAABTY/uuYm55n6Psc/s1600/P1013433.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4RCTbd6PNaI/VSYT3BtvURI/AAAAAAAABTY/uuYm55n6Psc/s1600/P1013433.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NniCJ6oMDV4/VSYT4SkHR6I/AAAAAAAABTg/9lcGa12SvWM/s1600/P1013446.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NniCJ6oMDV4/VSYT4SkHR6I/AAAAAAAABTg/9lcGa12SvWM/s1600/P1013446.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d3Ckre-XRjk/VSYT8w5tVmI/AAAAAAAABTo/PrvP-JQtdcg/s1600/P1013461.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d3Ckre-XRjk/VSYT8w5tVmI/AAAAAAAABTo/PrvP-JQtdcg/s1600/P1013461.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l_0ozDu3GNE/VSYUF_Adk9I/AAAAAAAABTw/JDqjRNH_r6I/s1600/P1013462.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l_0ozDu3GNE/VSYUF_Adk9I/AAAAAAAABTw/JDqjRNH_r6I/s1600/P1013462.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WgiAtvb0JTM/VSYUWvgh_OI/AAAAAAAABUI/GPgkaI5fm80/s1600/P1013479.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WgiAtvb0JTM/VSYUWvgh_OI/AAAAAAAABUI/GPgkaI5fm80/s1600/P1013479.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mR0Fwdt0RpE/VSYUJ1Jl-OI/AAAAAAAABT4/buHF_yZ7RSY/s1600/P1013466.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mR0Fwdt0RpE/VSYUJ1Jl-OI/AAAAAAAABT4/buHF_yZ7RSY/s1600/P1013466.JPG)  \n    \nHere's another recipe you might enjoy:  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PQW4w3pBwmI/VSYWYsJJOUI/AAAAAAAABUk/VvT-mAjAmgs/s1600/banana%2Bcake.JPG)](/2013/08/banana-cake-with-brown-sugar-buttercream.html)  \n    \n[Banana cake with fluffy brown sugar buttercream](/2013/08/banana-cake-with-brown-sugar-buttercream.html)"

There are no Panera Bread restaurants in the whole state. My husband's hometown recently announced Panera Bread will build a new location there, which is only about 6 hours away! If I have to drive 6 hours to get their summer corn chowder and baguettes, I will!  \n  \n In the meantime, I needed a fix for my cinnamon crunch bagel craving. I looked online for recipes, and I found several. (Apparently bloggers are on the same page). I tweaked my recipe from [Buns in My Oven](http://www.bunsinmyoven.com/2014/03/31/cinnamon-crunch-bagels/).  \n    \nCinnamon Crunch Bagels\n----------------------  \nYields: 12 bagels  \n  \nDough:  \n1 1/2 cups warm water  \n1/4 cup brown sugar, divided use  \n2 tsp active dry yeast  \n3 tsp cinnamon  \n1 1/2 tsp salt  \n5 cups flour  \n  \nTopping:  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1/4 cup brown sugar  \n3 tsp cinnamon  \n  \n1\\. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine water, 3 tbsp brown sugar, and yeast. Mix it and let it sit for 10 minutes, or until foamy.  \n  \n2\\. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 cups of the flour. Stir with a spoon or a whisk until combined. Attach the dough hook and slowly add flour until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl (it may not take all of the flour). Knead for 8-10 minutes.  \n  \n3\\. Let rise in a greased bowl covered, for 30-45 minutes in a warm oven (turn your oven onto warm for 5 minutes, then turn it off).  \n  \n4\\. Turn dough out onto a floured counter. Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls. Poke your thumb through the middle and stretch the hole a little bit to shape it like a bagel. Let sit for 10 minutes.  \n  \n5\\. Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the remaining 1 tbsp brown sugar. Boil the bagels, 2 at a time, for 45 seconds on each side. Pat dry with paper towels and place 2\" apart on a lined cookie sheet.  \n  \n6\\. Combine topping ingredients and sprinkle over the bagels. Bake at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 15-20 minutes, or until golden.  \n  \n7\\. Let cool and store at room temperature for 3-5 days. You can freeze them for up to a month.  \n  \n\\*\\*\\* I would recommend toasting these in a toaster oven with the sugar side up so it doesn't burn-- a regular toaster will probably burn the sugar! (I can't try it because we don't even have a regular toaster-- weird, right? My family always survived just fine without one so I don't see the point!)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u6LVVSzBk4U/VRdDscX3liI/AAAAAAAABRM/9BEJWMfBgHM/s1600/P1013220.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u6LVVSzBk4U/VRdDscX3liI/AAAAAAAABRM/9BEJWMfBgHM/s1600/P1013220.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFi9DpLpTdw/VRdDzvUy4KI/AAAAAAAABRU/kF5fSdIsZrU/s1600/P1013225.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFi9DpLpTdw/VRdDzvUy4KI/AAAAAAAABRU/kF5fSdIsZrU/s1600/P1013225.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GyXnjOIPoIQ/VRdD0oeDKHI/AAAAAAAABRc/CTNtzwMpzSo/s1600/P1013241.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GyXnjOIPoIQ/VRdD0oeDKHI/AAAAAAAABRc/CTNtzwMpzSo/s1600/P1013241.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mtfAc3X2bPU/VRdD8kNdJoI/AAAAAAAABRs/N911dMNqtEs/s1600/P1013254.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mtfAc3X2bPU/VRdD8kNdJoI/AAAAAAAABRs/N911dMNqtEs/s1600/P1013254.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y06HavNWrZE/VRdD37w4hsI/AAAAAAAABRk/PkM5acVEYNE/s1600/P1013258.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y06HavNWrZE/VRdD37w4hsI/AAAAAAAABRk/PkM5acVEYNE/s1600/P1013258.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NsSKHf69CJ0/VRdENfPmitI/AAAAAAAABR8/rtGT2mzW0AE/s1600/P1013288.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NsSKHf69CJ0/VRdENfPmitI/AAAAAAAABR8/rtGT2mzW0AE/s1600/P1013288.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PfJqfAI_gho/VRdEPKSf-8I/AAAAAAAABSE/ScExwK-WyL8/s1600/P1013307.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PfJqfAI_gho/VRdEPKSf-8I/AAAAAAAABSE/ScExwK-WyL8/s1600/P1013307.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IHcrowGyG5I/VRdNxJ23wnI/AAAAAAAABSc/qS1jWRfqRGo/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-03-28%2Bat%2B6.55.28%2BPM.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IHcrowGyG5I/VRdNxJ23wnI/AAAAAAAABSc/qS1jWRfqRGo/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-03-28%2Bat%2B6.55.28%2BPM.png)"

For as long as I can remember, my family has always stopped in West to buy dozens of kolaches.    \n    \nI have to clarify something for y'all: kolaches are sweet bread with fruit, cream cheese, or ricotta cheese filling-- NOT sausage in a roll.  \n  \nLet's review-- Pigs in a blanket (while still SO delicious, definitely **not** a kolache):  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xzlgjVRWWhA/VQTEW8s-V-I/AAAAAAAABQU/2_-HdDx6VeE/s1600/pig%2Bin%2Ba%2Bblanket.jpeg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xzlgjVRWWhA/VQTEW8s-V-I/AAAAAAAABQU/2_-HdDx6VeE/s1600/pig%2Bin%2Ba%2Bblanket.jpeg)  \n  \nKolaches:  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1clFD89-0HY/VQS1qhkiJ0I/AAAAAAAABPo/R3vFLbmxP-4/s1600/P1013182.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1clFD89-0HY/VQS1qhkiJ0I/AAAAAAAABPo/R3vFLbmxP-4/s1600/P1013182.JPG)  \n    \nDelicious, buttery rolls with a raspberry cream cheese filling and crumble topping-- yum. I adapted this recipe from _Saveur_ Magazine.   \n    \n    \nKolaches\n--------  \nYields: 16 kolaches  \n    \n**For the Dough**  \n1/2 cup warm water  \n1 tbsp active dry yeast (1/4 oz. package)  \n3 tbsp + 1 tsp sugar  \n4 tbsp butter, softened  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 egg yolk  \n3 1/2 cups flour  \n3/4 cup warm milk  \n    \n**For the Crumble**  \n1 tbsp butter, melted  \n1/4 cup flour  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n    \n1\\. Combine water, yeast, and 1 tsp sugar. Let sit for 5 minutes until activated.   \n    \n2\\. Beat butter and remaining 3 tbsp sugar together. Add the egg yolk and salt. Then, add the yeast mixture, flour, and milk. Combine and knead until no longer really sticky.   \n    \n3\\. Grease a bowl and add the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until doubled. I turned on my oven for 3 minutes, then I turned it off and let the dough rise in there. It was about 140 degrees.   \n    \n4\\. Preheat oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silpat.   \n    \n5\\. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Pinch them into round mounds, and place them 1/2\" apart on the prepared pan. Brush with 1 tbsp of melted butter. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.   \n    \n6\\. Prepare the filling (see below) and the crumble. (To make the crumble, combine the three ingredients until it's crumbly). When the kolaches have risen, press the center of each one down with your fingers. Put 1 tbsp of filling into each and sprinkle the crumble topping on each one.   \n    \n7\\. Bake at 375 degrees fahrenheit for 25-30 minutes.   \n    \n**Kolache Filling**  \n6 oz cream cheese, softened  \n1/4 tsp lemon juice  \n3 tbsp sugar  \n1 egg yolk  \n    \n1\\. Combine all of the ingredients together until completely smooth.  \n    \nFor fruit filling, use jam. I used raspberry jam.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B7gzx3aF_54/VQS1TWFALfI/AAAAAAAABPI/Nb5aTBY2Tyk/s1600/P1013149.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B7gzx3aF_54/VQS1TWFALfI/AAAAAAAABPI/Nb5aTBY2Tyk/s1600/P1013149.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-CbHB3SoAc/VQS1WEke3xI/AAAAAAAABPQ/cXqZN1UzHuU/s1600/P1013151.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-CbHB3SoAc/VQS1WEke3xI/AAAAAAAABPQ/cXqZN1UzHuU/s1600/P1013151.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s1XNXXQDzLs/VQS1ZHXsoTI/AAAAAAAABPY/_HhDdLKgf7Q/s1600/P1013164.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s1XNXXQDzLs/VQS1ZHXsoTI/AAAAAAAABPY/_HhDdLKgf7Q/s1600/P1013164.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rX1RI8-UCVw/VQS11DkcNBI/AAAAAAAABQA/iZ3zmC5ZNsM/s1600/P1013201.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rX1RI8-UCVw/VQS11DkcNBI/AAAAAAAABQA/iZ3zmC5ZNsM/s1600/P1013201.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x0OpaWGOitA/VQS1xNd6EwI/AAAAAAAABPw/HtCv5FxbXu4/s1600/P1013193.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x0OpaWGOitA/VQS1xNd6EwI/AAAAAAAABPw/HtCv5FxbXu4/s1600/P1013193.JPG)"

Pi Day is the day where you can unapologetically eat as much pizza and pie as you want, and that is a beautiful thing. It also happens to fall on my best friend's birthday. (Shout out to Kaki! Happy Birthday!)  \n    \nWhile I love celebrating Pi(e) Day, I have to say that pie crust isn't my favorite. I usually prefer pies with a different kind of crust. For this Chocolate Silk Pie, I decided to use a brownie crust, but you can use Oreo crumbs if you'd prefer. I just didn't have any Oreos, and I did have some brownies in the freezer from a while ago that were begging to be used.   \n    \nI've tried and failed in the past to make chocolate curls. This time, I used a web tutorial. They turned out really well! To learn more, you can go to [the link I used by clicking here](http://spicedblog.com/how-to-make-chocolate-curls.html). The recipe for this pie was adapted from [Use Real Butter](http://userealbutter.com/2013/05/22/french-silk-pie-recipe/).   \n    \nChocolate Silk Pie\n------------------  \nYields: 9-12 servings   \n    \n**Crust**  \n2 cups Oreo (or brownie-- I used a mixture of both!) crumbs  \n4 tbsp butter, melted  \n2 tbsp sugar  \n    \n**Chocolate Mousse**  \n8 oz dark chocolate  \n1 1/2 tsp vanilla  \n3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) butter, softened  \n1 cup sugar  \n3 eggs  \n1 cup whipping cream  \n    \n**Whipped cream**  \n2 cups whipping cream  \n3 tbsp powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp vanilla   \n    \n**Chocolate curls**  \n3 oz chocolate  \n    \n**Crust**  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Butter a 9\" springform or pie pan.   \n    \n2\\. In a food processor, crush Oreo cookies or brownies. Add the melted butter and sugar. (I omitted the sugar and butter because my brownies were very moist already-- not at all crumbly). Press into the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 10 minutes. Let cool completely.   \n    \n**Mousse**  \n3\\. Melt chocolate, stirring often, until smooth. Add vanilla and stir.   \n    \n4\\. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter for 1 minute on medium speed. Add sugar and beat for 4 minutes on medium speed. Add chocolate and beat until incorporated.   \n    \n5\\. Add 2 eggs and beat for 3 minutes. Add 3rd egg and beat for 3 more minutes.   \n    \n6\\. In a separate bowl, whip cream for 4 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream and mousse together until it's completely incorporated.   \n    \n7\\. Spread evenly on cooled crust.   \n    \n**Whipped Cream**  \n    \n8\\. In a bowl, combine cream, sugar, and vanilla. Whip until stiff peaks form. Pipe onto the pie or spread it evenly however you desire.   \n    \n**Chocolate Curls**  \n    \n9\\.

If I had to pick one, I'd probably say oatmeal.  \n  \nThese cookies are a simply a mash up of my three favorite kinds of cookies. They really are about 1/3 of each type. In each bite, you get a taste of each cookie.  \n  \nThese cookies are chewy and delicious. If you like crispy cookies, these probably aren't for you. They do have that delightful slight crunch on the bottom, but the inside is so chewy thanks to the brown sugar and peanut butter.  \n  \nTo make these cookies fit your dietary needs, you can make some simple alterations. To make them vegan, use margarine, vegan chocolate chips, and egg substitute. To make them gluten free, use gluten free flour and make sure there isn't hidden gluten in your other ingredients.  \n  \nI bake all of my cookies on a Silpat, which is a silicone baking sheet that fits into your cookie sheet. I never bake anything directly on my cookie sheets. Silicone baking sheets prevent sticking, and the don't allow the bottom of things to brown too much. It's great! If I forget to take my cookies off the sheet, they don't stick and break like they would on a regular cookie sheet. Here's a link to a silicone baking sheet.  \n  \n  \n  \nRecipe adapted from [Averie Cooks](http://www.averiecooks.com/2011/10/chocolate-chip-peanut-butter-oatmeal-cookies.html).  \n    \nChocolate Chip Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies\n--------------------------------------------  \nYields: 2 dozen medium cookies or 3 dozen small cookies  \n  \n1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)  \n1 1/4 cup brown sugar  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n1/3 cup peanut butter  \n1 egg + 1 egg yolk  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n1 1/4 cup flour  \n1 cup oats (I used old fashioned)  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1 cup chocolate chips  \n  \n1\\.

They seem unattainable... the layers, the flakiness, the golden color... Impossible, right? I tried to make croissants once before, and they didn't turn out as I wanted them to. These, however, turned out exactly how I wanted them to.  \n  \nThe best croissants I've ever had were at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco. They're unbelievably delicious. These croissants (not to toot my own horn) actually taste almost exactly the same as Tartine's croissants to me.  \n  \nI've been on a \"baking high\" all day. It's something I can only get from a successful attempt at a difficult and new recipe. Won't you join me in this baking high? These croissants take under 24 hours to make, which is wonderful, considering most recipes take 3 days. I adapted this recipe from Jellybean Journals.  \n    \n### Croissants  \nYields: 16 croissants  \n  \n**Dough**  \n3 1/2 cups flour  \n1 1/3 cups milk (room temperature)  \n2 1/4 tsp yeast (1 package)  \n1 tsp salt  \n2 tbsp vegetable oil  \n1 tbsp sugar  \n  \n**Laminating**  \n1 1/2 cups butter (3 sticks)  \n  \n**Egg wash**  \n1 egg  \n1 tbsp cream or milk  \n  \n1\\. Combine all of the dry dough ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer and stir with a whisk. Add the wet ingredients. Mix with the dough hook for 3 minutes. Take the dough out and knead by hand for 30 seconds to smooth out the dough.  \n  \n2\\. Let the dough rise in a greased bowl, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. I let mine rise in a room temperature oven.  \n  \n3\\. Unwrap the butter and put into a quart ziplock or plastic wrap. Beat the butter until it's an 8x8\" square. Put it back into the fridge until the dough is risen.  \n  \n4\\. Watch this video 2:11-3:30. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OAUM0MRgQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OAUM0MRgQw) This is how you laminate the dough. (This means you put the butter and \"turn\" the dough several times).  \n  \n5\\. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  \n  \n6\\. Divide the dough in half. Keep the second half wrapped in the fridge until you're ready to use it. Roll out half of the dough until it's 8\" by 20\". Cut it into 8 triangles. (You can watch the video to see how he cut his dough). I rolled each of my triangles out a little more before rolling them up.  \n  \n7\\. Place on a silpat (or parchment)-lined cookie sheet. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Mix the egg and cream together and brush on the croissants. Let rise for 1-2 hours.  \n  \n8\\. Bake at 375 for 25 minutes, or until desired golden color.  \n  \n\\*\\*\\*Croissants can be frozen and heated up in a 350 degrees fahrenheit oven for 8 minutes.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5BAV8kpvB-8/VNaTdoPEHGI/AAAAAAAABEI/PAJNeybLGh0/s1600/P1012686.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5BAV8kpvB-8/VNaTdoPEHGI/AAAAAAAABEI/PAJNeybLGh0/s1600/P1012686.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkr5fp0pUh8/VNaTuq9BSpI/AAAAAAAABEY/6ocjO5mxpXk/s1600/P1012697.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkr5fp0pUh8/VNaTuq9BSpI/AAAAAAAABEY/6ocjO5mxpXk/s1600/P1012697.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ENwq94gf8uI/VNaTzq0MkdI/AAAAAAAABEo/wfgeP0a9XyM/s1600/P1012703.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ENwq94gf8uI/VNaTzq0MkdI/AAAAAAAABEo/wfgeP0a9XyM/s1600/P1012703.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HdxHeJQHKFA/VNaUIpLDvrI/AAAAAAAABEw/4QqimgXZH-E/s1600/P1012708.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HdxHeJQHKFA/VNaUIpLDvrI/AAAAAAAABEw/4QqimgXZH-E/s1600/P1012708.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8vB9C9vhh8U/VNaUJQ1aSNI/AAAAAAAABE4/JzF_JTbRbMs/s1600/P1012713.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8vB9C9vhh8U/VNaUJQ1aSNI/AAAAAAAABE4/JzF_JTbRbMs/s1600/P1012713.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xyVY9znKv44/VNaUNvmTwNI/AAAAAAAABFA/c18Kln9eIrI/s1600/P1012716.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xyVY9znKv44/VNaUNvmTwNI/AAAAAAAABFA/c18Kln9eIrI/s1600/P1012716.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xFt_Lo1aGjQ/VNaTWoplKpI/AAAAAAAABEA/xTY0i2Srj94/s1600/P1012693.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xFt_Lo1aGjQ/VNaTWoplKpI/AAAAAAAABEA/xTY0i2Srj94/s1600/P1012693.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yyv3Af0c2vg/VNaUj6_YR_I/AAAAAAAABFU/DevktvnBrOQ/s1600/P1012725.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yyv3Af0c2vg/VNaUj6_YR_I/AAAAAAAABFU/DevktvnBrOQ/s1600/P1012725.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PgNgwSkWSnw/VNaU6xnH6BI/AAAAAAAABFs/rYcW9-A5c1Q/s1600/P1012743.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PgNgwSkWSnw/VNaU6xnH6BI/AAAAAAAABFs/rYcW9-A5c1Q/s1600/P1012743.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

They're butter cookies filled with a smooth chocolate ganache. What more could a girl want? Recipe tweaked from Sunny Side Up.   \n    \n### Homemade Milano Cookies  \nYields: about 3 dozen sandwich cookies  \n  \n12 tbsp butter, softened  \n2 1/2 cups powdered sugar  \n5 egg whites  \n2 tbsp vanilla  \n1 1/2 cups flour  \n  \n1 cup dark chocolate chips (I used 60% Ghiradelli)  \n4 tbsp cream (give or take)  \n  \n1\\. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Line two cookie sheets with silpat mats.  \n  \n2\\. Cream the butter on medium high speed until it's smooth. Add the powdered sugar slowly.  \n  \n3\\. Add the egg whites and vanilla, then add the flour. Beat until just combined.  \n  \n4\\. Put the batter into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2\" round tip. Pipe 2\" long sections 2\" apart. At this point, I put my cookie sheets with the cookie batter on it into the freezer for 3-4 minutes so the cookies wouldn't spread so much. This made them a better consistency in the end.  \n  \n5\\. Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden.  \n  \n6\\. Microwave cream until scalding, then pour on top of chocolate chips. Stir until melted. Add more chocolate or cream to achieve the desired consistency. Pipe onto cookies and sandwich them together.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fOoZ1MkryK4/VM2xciRRC2I/AAAAAAAABDQ/u18X6BnOiv4/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.52.44%2BPM.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fOoZ1MkryK4/VM2xciRRC2I/AAAAAAAABDQ/u18X6BnOiv4/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.52.44%2BPM.png)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c6UshQiklRQ/VM2xcp5ewHI/AAAAAAAABDU/7xabHwCf18M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.52.58%2BPM.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c6UshQiklRQ/VM2xcp5ewHI/AAAAAAAABDU/7xabHwCf18M/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.52.58%2BPM.png)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kVJae1vuaTc/VM2wkpZt2fI/AAAAAAAABDE/JzHjQlQICFI/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.49.49%2BPM.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kVJae1vuaTc/VM2wkpZt2fI/AAAAAAAABDE/JzHjQlQICFI/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-01-31%2Bat%2B9.49.49%2BPM.png)"

Any objections? Good. I made this recipe a few weeks ago for a work potluck, but there wasn't time to photograph the pretzel bites. I had to make the recipe again (Oh, woe is me!).  \n  \nThese taste just like little bite-sized pieces of those delicious cinnamon sugar mall pretzels. I've also included a cream cheese dipping sauce, which is the perfect amount of tanginess to go with these delicious pretzel bites!  \n    \n### Cinnamon Sugar Soft Pretzel Bites  \nYields: about 100 small pretzel bites  \n    \n1 cup warm water  \n1 tbsp (or 1 packet) dry active yeast  \n2 tbsp sugar + 1 tsp sugar  \n2 tbsp brown sugar  \n1 tbsp vegetable oil  \n1 tsp salt  \n2 3/4 to 3 cups flour  \n  \n3 cups _hot_ water (I microwaved mine in a pyrex for about 4 minutes)  \n1/3 cup baking soda  \n  \n1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, melted  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp cinnamon  \n  \n1\\. Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 tsp of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir with your finger, then let it sit for about 10 minutes to activate.  \n  \n2\\. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of sugar, the brown sugar, veggie oil, and salt. Stir. Attach the dough hook and add the flour. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Knead in the mixer for about 4 minutes or so, or until elastic and smooth.  \n  \n3\\. Put in a greased glass bowl and let rise, covered, in a warm oven (about 140-150 degrees fahrenheit) for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. After removing from the oven, preheat the oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.  \n  \n4\\. Combine hot water and baking soda. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Take one part and cover the other parts with a kitchen towel so they don't dry out. Roll the section into a snake about 28-30 inches long. Cut it in half, then each in half again. (4 snakes) Divide each into about 1-1/4\" sections.  \n  \n5\\. Dip each bite into the hot water/baking soda mixture, then place on a silpat-lined (or parchment paper lined) baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining sections of dough.  \n  \n6\\. Bake at 425 for 7-10 minutes, or until the tops are golden.  \n  \n7\\. Roll in the melted butter, let sit on a plate for about 1 minute to let the butter soak in, and then roll in the cinnamon sugar mixture.  \n  \n  \nCream Cheese Dipping Sauce  \n4 oz cream cheese (1/2 of a regular pack)  \n1 tbsp butter, softened  \n1 1/4 cup powdered sugar  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n2 tsp milk, optional  \n  \nCombine cream cheese and butter. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat. Add milk, if needed, to attain the desired consistency.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVyjVwopHc/VMQFyHJLMaI/AAAAAAAAA_k/t6K4uqwZhF8/s1600/P1012565.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVyjVwopHc/VMQFyHJLMaI/AAAAAAAAA_k/t6K4uqwZhF8/s1600/P1012565.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CQ9wi1zKSHM/VMQFvAhNQVI/AAAAAAAAA_c/Bk7HT3FcSlw/s1600/P1012569.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CQ9wi1zKSHM/VMQFvAhNQVI/AAAAAAAAA_c/Bk7HT3FcSlw/s1600/P1012569.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l8TZxn9EaWQ/VMQF2_Axj1I/AAAAAAAAA_s/SPzf9B250eQ/s1600/P1012587.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l8TZxn9EaWQ/VMQF2_Axj1I/AAAAAAAAA_s/SPzf9B250eQ/s1600/P1012587.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HKecGsW3JXc/VMQGADkm5MI/AAAAAAAAA_8/DUm1jdr7PxM/s1600/P1012605.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HKecGsW3JXc/VMQGADkm5MI/AAAAAAAAA_8/DUm1jdr7PxM/s1600/P1012605.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x3QpN5uJgxA/VMQGOiVzsYI/AAAAAAAABAE/pNklk_Fn7Nc/s1600/P1012618.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x3QpN5uJgxA/VMQGOiVzsYI/AAAAAAAABAE/pNklk_Fn7Nc/s1600/P1012618.JPG)"

Am I the only one? Where could one even get a Boston Cream Pie? Maybe it's a Northerner thing. Being from Texas, I'm more used to seeing Bluebell and peach cobbler at restaurants.  \n  \nDoes anyone remember the show Arthur? The animated one with the aardvark (A-A-R-D-V-A-R-K)? I remember there was one episode where there was this delicious looking Boston Cream Pie, and ever since then, I've wanted to try it.  \n  \nLast year, I made [Boston Cream Pie Cupcakes](/2014/04/boston-cream-pie-cupcakes.html). This morning, I decided I wanted Boston Cream Pie, but in donut form.  \n  \nThese are no ordinary donuts. These will leave you wanting another... and another... until you've eaten the whole batch. Don't say I didn't warn you.  \n    \n### Boston Cream Pie Donuts  \nYields: 12 donuts (I made 10 + about 12 donut holes)  \n  \n**For the Pastry Cream**  \n1 cup half & half  \n3 egg yolks  \n1/3 cup sugar  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n2 tbsp flour  \n2 tbsp butter, softened  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n  \n**For the Donuts **  \n2 tbsp warm water  \n1 tbsp yeast  \n3/4 cup warm whole milk  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 egg  \n3 tbsp butter, softened  \n2 1/2 to 3 cups flour  \nVegetable oil (for frying)  \n  \n**For the Glaze**  \n3 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips  \n1/4 cup heavy whipping cream  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp butter  \n  \n**Pastry Cream**  \n1\\. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the half & half until simmering. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, salt, and flour.  \n  \n2\\. Add about 1/4 cup of the simmering milk to the egg yolk mixture and whisk until it's smooth. Then, while stirring constantly, add the egg mixture to the milk on the stove. Cook until it begins to thicken, then turn heat down to low for about 1 minute. Cook until desired consistency is reached (I wanted mine to me about like yogurt).  \n  \n3\\. Pour pastry cream into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap (actually touch the plastic wrap to the top of the pastry cream to prevent it from drying out).  \n  \n**Donuts**  \n4\\. Mix together the warm water and yeast. Let sit for about 5 minutes, or until activated.  \n  \n5\\. Pour yeast mixture in the bottom of a stand mixer. Add milk, sugar, salt, egg, butter, and 1 cup of the flour. Mix with a regular paddle attachment for about 2 minutes.  \n  \n6\\. Switch to the dough hook and add the remainder of the flour. It should come clean off the sides of the bowl when you've added enough flour.  \n  \n7\\. Grease a bowl and put the dough in. Cover with a damp towel. Let it rise until doubled, about 1 hour. (I let mine rise in my oven after turning it on for 3 minutes to warm it up a bit).  \n  \n8\\. Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, until it's about 3/4 of an inch thick. Cut into 3\" circles. Put on a floured cookie sheet, cover with a damp towel again, and let rise until doubled (about 30 minutes).  \n  \n9\\. Heat up your oil until it's 350 degrees fahrenheit. Use a spatula to put 2 donuts at a time in the oil. They take about 45 secs-1 minute on each side. Put on a plate covered with paper towels.  \n  \n**Glaze**  \n10\\. Combine cream, sugar, and butter and microwave for about 30 seconds. Pour over chocolate chips and stir until smooth. Add more chocolate, sugar, or cream to your taste or desired consistency.  \n  \n**Assembly**  \nUse a chopstick to poke a hole in the side of the donut. Pipe the pastry cream using a piping bag and an open circle tip. Dip the tops in the ganache glaze.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBseVl0nLM0/VLrgn489e_I/AAAAAAAAA-U/RMQATwepi80/s1600/P1012510.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PBseVl0nLM0/VLrgn489e_I/AAAAAAAAA-U/RMQATwepi80/s1600/P1012510.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TToztYJ6b-k/VLrgm99ZqSI/AAAAAAAAA-M/lEkxPhMllHU/s1600/P1012519.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TToztYJ6b-k/VLrgm99ZqSI/AAAAAAAAA-M/lEkxPhMllHU/s1600/P1012519.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aealmPpUlOA/VLrgnXhedNI/AAAAAAAAA-Q/dhQy1qA9r4k/s1600/P1012523.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aealmPpUlOA/VLrgnXhedNI/AAAAAAAAA-Q/dhQy1qA9r4k/s1600/P1012523.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l1klevb1su0/VLrg1Qhg7VI/AAAAAAAAA-s/qBIIyq_Bqxk/s1600/P1012527.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l1klevb1su0/VLrg1Qhg7VI/AAAAAAAAA-s/qBIIyq_Bqxk/s1600/P1012527.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bsOwIWvP8zs/VLrg2j0jcjI/AAAAAAAAA-0/J1mQLiXW4N4/s1600/P1012538.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bsOwIWvP8zs/VLrg2j0jcjI/AAAAAAAAA-0/J1mQLiXW4N4/s1600/P1012538.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lXp4vbV26_E/VLrgz0wg4jI/AAAAAAAAA-k/qNbNrGt8p-w/s1600/P1012553.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lXp4vbV26_E/VLrgz0wg4jI/AAAAAAAAA-k/qNbNrGt8p-w/s1600/P1012553.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cLFVI2Yqb7k/VLrg7A_gIXI/AAAAAAAAA-8/X8fi3k__Kwo/s1600/P1012563.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cLFVI2Yqb7k/VLrg7A_gIXI/AAAAAAAAA-8/X8fi3k__Kwo/s1600/P1012563.JPG)"

I've never been the biggest fan of pecans, so my mom would make my some turtles without pecans. Just caramel dipped in chocolate, but _so delicious_. She's the best like that. : )   \n    \nAnyway, my sister is having some surgery, so I decided to send her a package. Since one of our best friends also happens to live in the same city as my sister, I made them a care package. Hope they love it! I packed it full of baked goodies. My sister typically tries to avoid sugar and flour (basically two of my main food groups), so I also made her some gluten free, sugar free almond joy bars.   \n    \nFor Lian, the food connoisseur, I made these turtle thumbprint cookies. Fun fact: she has a Pinterest board specifically for pinning foods she wants me to make for her. Actually, I have 3 friends who have boards specifically for foods they want me to make for them. I guess that's what happens when you're the \"**Baker Friend**.\"    \n### Turtle Thumbprint Cookies  \n**Yields: 30 small cookies**  \n**Cookies**  \n    \n1 cup flour  \n1/3 cup cocoa powder  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  \n2/3 cup sugar  \n1 egg, separated yolk and white  \n2 tbsp milk  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 1/4 tsp finely chopped pecans AND/OR shredded coconut   \n    \n**Caramel Filling**  \n    \n15 soft caramel candies (I used Werther's Original)  \n1-2 tbsp cream  \n    \n**Chocolate Drizzle**  \n    \n1/4 cup chocolate chips   \n1/2 tsp vegetable oil  \n    \n1\\. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar. Add in the egg yolk, milk, and vanilla. Add in the dry ingredients.   \n    \n2\\. Put the dough, covered, in the fridge for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.   \n    \n3\\. Whisk the egg white in a small bowl until slightly frothy. Using a teaspoon, scoop out the cookie dough. Roll it into a ball and dip into the egg white, then roll in the pecans (or coconut).   \n    \n4\\. Place them 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet. Press the center slightly down with a teaspoon. Bake for 8-12 minutes.   \n    \n5\\. Let the cookies cool. Melt the caramel and cream together for about 45 seconds. Stir and put into a sandwich bag. Cut off a small bit of the corner and squeeze a little bit on each cookie.  \n    \n6\\. Melt the chocolate and oil together. Put it into a sandwich bag and cut off a small bit of the corner and drizzle on the cookies.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-efJjawxdqUM/VJHv_IN4LBI/AAAAAAAAAVE/Y3RWJ8dx9-A/s1600/P1012406.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-efJjawxdqUM/VJHv_IN4LBI/AAAAAAAAAVE/Y3RWJ8dx9-A/s1600/P1012406.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_tO1y7KCM6Y/VJHv_wEaVvI/AAAAAAAAAVI/dVcqC4MBce4/s1600/P1012431.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_tO1y7KCM6Y/VJHv_wEaVvI/AAAAAAAAAVI/dVcqC4MBce4/s1600/P1012431.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gP697WHQryE/VJHvnNBVl3I/AAAAAAAAAU8/hAycsZBmJ1Y/s1600/P1012454.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gP697WHQryE/VJHvnNBVl3I/AAAAAAAAAU8/hAycsZBmJ1Y/s1600/P1012454.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oDharO3yAV0/VJHwQFY8IgI/AAAAAAAAAVU/KQ3OAyRo3sg/s1600/P1012467.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oDharO3yAV0/VJHwQFY8IgI/AAAAAAAAAVU/KQ3OAyRo3sg/s1600/P1012467.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5g9YRnjBLY/VJHwax4-AXI/AAAAAAAAAVc/owPCQaH6lm8/s1600/P1012475.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5g9YRnjBLY/VJHwax4-AXI/AAAAAAAAAVc/owPCQaH6lm8/s1600/P1012475.JPG)"

It has only snowed once so far, and it melted in the blink of an eye. It feels like a Texas winter. It's been raining much more than it's been snowing. Usually the snowy season begins before Halloween!  \n  \nDespite the strange weather, I still crave hot chocolate quite often. One thing that's kind of weird about is me is that I don't like regular marshmallows. I like the tiny marshmallows that come in the packet of hot chocolate (I know, I know). I also like homemade marshmallows.  \n  \nThere was a magic grocery store called Central Market near my house growing up. I used to love to sample the homemade marshmallows. I've always wanted to try to make them.  \n  \nLast night, as I was avoiding anything resembling studying for finals, I decided to make some homemade marshmallows. I'm seriously impressed with how easy these are! Next time, I'd love to experiment with adding peppermint flavoring instead of the vanilla or adding some melted chocolate chips during the whipping. Yum!  \n    \n### Fluffy Homemade Marshmallows  \nYields: about 100 marshmallows    \n    \n3 (.25 oz) packets of unflavored gelatin (usually a box comes with 4)  \n1 cup cold water, divided  \n1 1/2 cups sugar  \n1 cup light corn syrup  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1 tsp vanilla extract (or peppermint extract, or any flavor!)  \n1/2 cup powdered sugar  \n1/2 cup cornstarch  \n  \n**Preparing the marshmallows**  \n1\\. Put 1/2 cup of the water into the bottom of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the packets of gelatin and give it a quick stir.  \n  \n2\\. Combine remaining water, sugar, corn syrup, and salt into a small sauce pan over medium-high  heat. Cover and cook for 4 minutes.  \n  \n3\\. Uncover the pan and clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Keep cooking until it reaches 240 degrees fahrenheit. It took me about 8-10 minutes. Once it reaches 240 degrees, immediately remove the pan from heat.  \n  \n**Whipping the marshmallows**  \n4\\. With the mixer on a low speed, slowly poor the sugar mixture into the gelatin mixture in the mixer. Once it's all in the mixer, turn the mixer on high speed for 15 minutes, or until the mixture looks like marshmallow creme: white, fluffy, and lukewarm. Add vanilla during the last minute of mixing.  \n  \n**Setting the marshmallows**  \n5\\. Mix the powdered sugar and cornstarch together in a bowl. **Lightly** spray with cooking spray a 9x13 pan (after you spray, it would be good to use a paper towel to remove the excess spray from the pan. You just want a very light layer or it will color the marshmallows yellow!) then dust the pan with the sugar/cornstarch.  \n  \n6\\. Spread the marshmallow in the pan to be as even as you can. Then, dust the top with powdered sugar/cornstarch. After you do this, you can pat it more evenly with your hands.  \n  \n**Cutting the marshmallows**  \n7\\. Leave it, uncovered, for at least 4 hours. I left mine overnight. Afterward, cut the marshmallows into cubes. Toss them with powdered sugar/cornstarch to prevent them from getting too sticky.  \n  \nStore them in an airtight container for up to 1 month!  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MJjrNs7iGjw/VIITT7cow9I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/OsJl8H7yNUc/s1600/P1012262.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MJjrNs7iGjw/VIITT7cow9I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/OsJl8H7yNUc/s1600/P1012262.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-STE_hO0ZXGU/VIITTHyZpKI/AAAAAAAAAQw/SMfUzv-r2vU/s1600/P1012265.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-STE_hO0ZXGU/VIITTHyZpKI/AAAAAAAAAQw/SMfUzv-r2vU/s1600/P1012265.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHne8nYjeeg/VIIThI7I-8I/AAAAAAAAARI/a6vPy9sAFX0/s1600/P1012270.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHne8nYjeeg/VIIThI7I-8I/AAAAAAAAARI/a6vPy9sAFX0/s1600/P1012270.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QNtkxxFcFtg/VIITicoHYEI/AAAAAAAAARQ/l9UAodSwNzA/s1600/P1012271.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QNtkxxFcFtg/VIITicoHYEI/AAAAAAAAARQ/l9UAodSwNzA/s1600/P1012271.JPG)"

They're super quick (1 hour!) and they're fluffy. They remind me of the delicious rolls the lunch ladies made for lunch back in elementary school. (Confession: I used to trade my chicken rings for those rolls. Yes. I've always been a carb addict)  \n    \nThese rolls are a great way to fancy up a simple weeknight meal, and they'd also make a great addition to your Thanksgiving dinner!   \n### 1 Hour Dinner Rolls  \nYield: 12 rolls  \n    \n3/4 cup milk  \n4 tbsp butter  \n3/4 cup hot water  \n4 tbsp sugar  \n1 tsp salt  \n4 to 4 1/2 cups flour  \n1 tbsp yeast   \n    \n1\\. Microwave milk and butter in a pyrex measuring cup or other microwave safe bowl for 2 minutes. Pour it into the bottom of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment.   \n    \n2\\. Add the hot water, sugar, and salt. Add 2 cups of flour and mix with the dough hook for about 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the mixer with a spatula to get the excess flour incorporated.   \n    \n3\\. Add the yeast and mix for 1 minute. Add the remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, just until the dough pulls away from the sides, leaving the bowl almost clean. (You may need less or more than called for based off your altitude, etc.) Once there's enough flour, mix on medium-low for 5 minutes.   \n    \n4\\. Cover the mixer with plastic wrap or the like and let it sit for 5 minutes. While it's sitting, preheat your oven to 170 degrees fahrenheit.   \n    \n5\\. After the dough has sat for 5 minutes, plop it onto the counter. Divide (using a dough cutter or a large knife) it into 12 equal pieces (I divided it in half (2), then those in half again (4), then each of those into 3 pieces (12).) I shape them by stretching them and then pinching the bottom together really well.   \n    \n6\\. Butter the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan and put the rolls in the pan. Put them in the warm oven, uncovered, and let them rise for about 20-30 minutes. Leaving them in the oven, turn the oven up to 350 degrees fahrenheit. It took my rolls about 15-18 minutes to bake.\\*  \n    \n\\*Obviously, it depends on your oven. I also chose to turn the pan about halfway through because my oven bakes a little unevenly.   \n    \n7\\. Brush with butter right when they come out of the oven. Bon appétit!   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bJjPH_GLRuw/VHLmpLiORXI/AAAAAAAAAPU/pXnN7OOZL60/s1600/P1012200.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bJjPH_GLRuw/VHLmpLiORXI/AAAAAAAAAPU/pXnN7OOZL60/s1600/P1012200.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8rijgWkCCag/VHLmvXUtfRI/AAAAAAAAAPg/GTBenRVmBHg/s1600/P1012211.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8rijgWkCCag/VHLmvXUtfRI/AAAAAAAAAPg/GTBenRVmBHg/s1600/P1012211.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wM35SmCZl4k/VHLm0yi1ADI/AAAAAAAAAPs/aqMzYYUVedA/s1600/P1012241.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wM35SmCZl4k/VHLm0yi1ADI/AAAAAAAAAPs/aqMzYYUVedA/s1600/P1012241.JPG)"

Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Line a cupcake pan with liners.    \n    \n2\\. Put veggie oil, chocolate chips, and butter into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring every 30 seconds, until just melted.  \n    \n3\\. Combine flour, baking soda and powder, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk until combined.   \n    \n4\\. In a large bowl, combine sugars, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until combined. Add the melted chocolate mixture, then whisk until combined.   \n    \n5\\. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the yogurt to the sugar mixture. Mix until just combined (I didn't even use my stand mixer. I just used a whisk). Add in the hot water last, and mix until it's combined.   \n    \n6\\. Use a cookie scoop to divide the batter evenly between the cupcake liners. I filled mine about 3/4 of the way full, but I would fill a little bit less next time. (High altitude messes everything up!!!)  \n    \n7\\.

I know. It's everyone else's least favorite flavor). My husband is a huge chocolate fan, so I thought we'd find a recipe that includes both of our favorite flavors.  \n  \nThe best part of these muffins is they're made in one bowl. I whipped them up in less than 10 minutes before baking. One bowl recipes are the best because usually when I bake, I make a huge mess in the kitchen. This way, I only have to clean one bowl.  \n  \nI modified this recipe from [Fork Knife Swoon](http://www.forkknifeswoon.com/food-drink/breakfast-brunch/2014/02/dark-chocolate-banana-muffins/).  \n    \n### One Bowl Chocolate Banana Muffins  \nYields 12 muffins  \n  \n1 cup overly ripe bananas (about 2 medium-large bananas)  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 egg  \n1/2 cup veggie or canola oil  \n1/3 cup milk  \n2/3 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp brown sugar  \n2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 1/4 tsp baking soda  \n1 2/3 cups flour  \n1/3 cup mini chocolate chips (I didn't have mini, so I used regular)  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Line a muffin pan with 12 muffin liners.  \n  \n2\\. In a large bowl, mash bananas (I used a potato masher). Add vanilla and egg. Stir well. Add oil and milk and stir well.  \n  \n2\\. Add sugars and mix well, then add cocoa powder and stir well. The cocoa powder doesn't incorporate as easily, so you may have to do some extra stirring.  \n  \n3\\. Add salt and baking soda. Mix well. Add flour and stir until just incorporated.  \n  \n4\\. Add about half of the chocolate chips to the batter and reserve the rest. Scoop the muffin batter with a cookie scoop into the liners, about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the muffin batter.  \n  \n5\\. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  \n  \nThey're great warm or at room temperature!    \n    \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRYWyrHaPZw/VE1lBBJcZrI/AAAAAAAAAL0/B5COJgVaM-M/s1600/P1011879.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRYWyrHaPZw/VE1lBBJcZrI/AAAAAAAAAL0/B5COJgVaM-M/s1600/P1011879.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vwlxf2sK-RU/VE1lBH0gmkI/AAAAAAAAALw/x1WhfGNlMdg/s1600/P1011891.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vwlxf2sK-RU/VE1lBH0gmkI/AAAAAAAAALw/x1WhfGNlMdg/s1600/P1011891.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rwazcelYnLY/VE1lXHUKVpI/AAAAAAAAAMI/vmhprERMNd4/s1600/P1011910.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rwazcelYnLY/VE1lXHUKVpI/AAAAAAAAAMI/vmhprERMNd4/s1600/P1011910.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KCb8utrPhC8/VE1lXcs12EI/AAAAAAAAAMM/a0vV8rxidhc/s1600/P1011924.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KCb8utrPhC8/VE1lXcs12EI/AAAAAAAAAMM/a0vV8rxidhc/s1600/P1011924.JPG)  \n    \nOther recipes you may love:  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wE_V-fpkpCg/VE1rfGxN1SI/AAAAAAAAAMg/ZjEIvfiMxlI/s1600/nutella.JPG)](/2013/08/chocolate-nutella-banana-bread.html)  \n    \n[Nutella Banana Bread](/2013/08/chocolate-nutella-banana-bread.html)  \n    \nHappy baking!"

I've been wanting to bake something pumpkin-y that wasn't pumpkin bread, muffins, or cookies. I often feel like my most creative recipes are born at night right before I go to bed. See, this is when I have the most creative cravings-- right when I'm about to go to sleep and can't make them. Does this happen to anyone else?  \n  \nAnyway, I usually ask Austin to write my recipes down in his phone so I won't forget about them. I thought of this one about two weeks ago. I had to do some recipe research, because I wanted to make sure these were good. Cinnamon can prevent yeast from rising, so I had to figure out exactly how much I could add so it would still rise, but have enough cinnamon flavor. Also, I don't like when soft pretzels are bagel-like. I don't want my soft pretzels to have rubbery texture!  \n  \nThese are dang good, y'all.  \n  \nYou can make the dough in a bread maker, using a stand mixer, or kneading by hand.    \n### Cinnamon Sugar Pumpkin Soft Pretzels  \nYields: 12 pretzels  \n  \n**Dough**  \n1 1/2 cups warm water  \n1 tbsp active dry yeast  \n2 tbsp brown sugar  \n1/2 cup pumpkin purée  \n4 cups flour  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice  \n  \n**Soak**  \n2 cups hot water  \n2 tsp baking soda  \n  \n**Topping**  \n3 tbsp butter, melted  \n5 tbsp sugar  \n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice  \n  \n**Cream Cheese Dipping Sauce**  \n3 oz cream cheese, room temperature  \n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar  \n2 tbsp milk  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n  \nDirections:  \n  \nBread machine: Put all ingredients in the bread machine in the order prescribed by your instruction manual. Let it knead the dough and rise ONCE until doubled in size, then remove to shape.  \n  \nMixer or hand: Combine water, yeast, and brown sugar. Let the yeast active for about 5-10 minutes. Add the remaining dough ingredients and knead with a dough hook for 4 minutes or by hand for 6 minutes, or until it springs back when you gently press your thumb into the dough.  \n  \nTo shape: Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll into a 18\"-20\" snake. Shape it as a pretzel. [Watch this video for more information](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwy9c0foFTc).  \n  \nTo soak: Combine the water and baking soda. Quickly dip each pretzel into the hot water and baking soda mixture for about 3 seconds, then place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment or a silpat.  \n  \nTo bake: Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Let your pretzels rise on top of the oven as it heats up, about 20 minutes. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, or until the tops begin to turn golden.  \n  \nTo top: Brush the melted butter on the hot pretzels, then sprinkle with combined sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture.  \n  \nTo make the dipping sauce: Beat all the ingredients together.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LPiITEVjewA/VDhE4GdO8CI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/04rnmkoTw7k/s1600/P1011685.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LPiITEVjewA/VDhE4GdO8CI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/04rnmkoTw7k/s1600/P1011685.jpg)  \n    \nAfter the soak, before rising  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jEFyEPByivg/VDhE1j8sdOI/AAAAAAAAAJs/BMvSIn9nHuY/s1600/P1011700.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jEFyEPByivg/VDhE1j8sdOI/AAAAAAAAAJs/BMvSIn9nHuY/s1600/P1011700.JPG)  \n    \nAfter baking, before butter/cinnamon sugar  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3WSRnqtbSNM/VDhE4Rfv6KI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/vVKE4Lvpq5k/s1600/P1011726.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3WSRnqtbSNM/VDhE4Rfv6KI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/vVKE4Lvpq5k/s1600/P1011726.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ItDprh6OYm8/VDhFSl3x3ZI/AAAAAAAAAKE/Q5ioLoSXfu8/s1600/P1011735.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ItDprh6OYm8/VDhFSl3x3ZI/AAAAAAAAAKE/Q5ioLoSXfu8/s1600/P1011735.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uO8ifXej96U/VDhKQ3I1GZI/AAAAAAAAAK4/mcd7Frcw3_s/s1600/P1019796.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uO8ifXej96U/VDhKQ3I1GZI/AAAAAAAAAK4/mcd7Frcw3_s/s1600/P1019796.JPG)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6MN-4y7bhVY/VDhFWXhQoDI/AAAAAAAAAKM/phJP9Hb9BbM/s1600/P1011779.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6MN-4y7bhVY/VDhFWXhQoDI/AAAAAAAAAKM/phJP9Hb9BbM/s1600/P1011779.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KykqPmZyTL4/VDhFicov2HI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SrsvWCqRpGo/s1600/P1011819.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KykqPmZyTL4/VDhFicov2HI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SrsvWCqRpGo/s1600/P1011819.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f8SD4xA4fxQ/VDhGBE_JccI/AAAAAAAAAKc/-QFVB2dwoMc/s1600/P1011823.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f8SD4xA4fxQ/VDhGBE_JccI/AAAAAAAAAKc/-QFVB2dwoMc/s1600/P1011823.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N-ETJbiLP4Q/VDhGDwMVidI/AAAAAAAAAKk/68rVSxRG1pY/s1600/P1011825.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N-ETJbiLP4Q/VDhGDwMVidI/AAAAAAAAAKk/68rVSxRG1pY/s1600/P1011825.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EkDtmJaUcBE/VDhGITDqDJI/AAAAAAAAAKs/YaRIx2z01yY/s1600/P1011837.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EkDtmJaUcBE/VDhGITDqDJI/AAAAAAAAAKs/YaRIx2z01yY/s1600/P1011837.JPG)  \n    \nHappy October!  \n    \nHere are some other recipes you may like:   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X9MC9P8b0KM/VDhKro8wzGI/AAAAAAAAALA/YoK0_omS1Q4/s1600/WM%2BSoft%2BPretzels%2B(1).JPG)](/2013/04/auntie-annes-copycat.html)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hpDFmJvEu6Y/VDhK7K1Wr1I/AAAAAAAAALI/wMWhzxtYjWk/s1600/P1011111.JPG)](/2013/10/pumpkin-muffins.html)"

That's right. Pumpkin. Cheesecake. Bread. It has the best of all worlds.  \n  \nI mixed this recipe up a little bit. This is my favorite pumpkin bread recipe. I love it! I found this recipe years ago. It's called \"Pumpkin Pie Bread.\" This bread tastes like pumpkin pie, people. Pumpkin pie. In bread form.  \n  \nAlso, I'm kind of obsessed with cheesecake swirls, so I added one of those. Delish.  \n    \n### Pumpkin Cheesecake Bread  \nYields: 2 loaves (either 8x4 or 9x5-- I did one of each!)  \n  \n**Pumpkin Bread Batter**  \n3 1/2 cups flour  \n2 tsp baking soda  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1 tsp salt  \n1 1/2 tbsp pumpkin pie spice  \n2 1/2 cups sugar  \n1 cup veggie oil (or canola oil)  \n4 eggs  \n1 (15 oz.) can pumpkin purée  \n1/2 cup water  \n  \n**Cheesecake Swirl**  \n  \n1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese, room temperature  \n1/3 cup sugar  \n2 tbsp flour  \n2 eggs  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease two loaf pans (8x4 or 9x5 will work perfectly).  \n  \n2\\. Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. Set aside.  \n  \n3\\. Beat together in a large bowl (a stand mixer works well) the sugar with the veggie oil. Add the eggs one at a time, beating between each egg. Add the pumpkin.  \n  \n4\\. Add the dry ingredients slowly alternating with the water. Mix until combined.  \n  \n5\\. Beat together the cheesecake swirl ingredients until smooth.  \n  \n6\\. Pour a little more than half the batter between the two pans. Spread all of the cheesecake swirl batter in the two pans. Try to spread it out evenly, extending almost to the edges. Pour the remaining pumpkin batter on top and completely cover up the cheesecake swirl.  \n  \n7\\. Bake for 55-70 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean.  \n  \n8\\. Let the bread cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then remove them and let them finish cooling on a cooling rack. Store in plastic wrap.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iUEBiNtWlbw/VCZK8fO7JKI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8fDr32E3cmA/s1600/P1011643.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iUEBiNtWlbw/VCZK8fO7JKI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8fDr32E3cmA/s1600/P1011643.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WE8I2wsjaRc/VCZK26T_ifI/AAAAAAAAAIU/rkw7LUnP7aE/s1600/P1011640.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WE8I2wsjaRc/VCZK26T_ifI/AAAAAAAAAIU/rkw7LUnP7aE/s1600/P1011640.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dnR-nB4iBc8/VCZKwPJTGLI/AAAAAAAAAIM/2AuATViSi_U/s1600/P1011620.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dnR-nB4iBc8/VCZKwPJTGLI/AAAAAAAAAIM/2AuATViSi_U/s1600/P1011620.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2OV9qxIxRkA/VCZKcF-4chI/AAAAAAAAAH0/pHajmK_s--4/s1600/P1011528.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2OV9qxIxRkA/VCZKcF-4chI/AAAAAAAAAH0/pHajmK_s--4/s1600/P1011528.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GtziuGztrXE/VCZKaFgnOUI/AAAAAAAAAHo/dn14mvBr7lM/s1600/P1011547.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GtziuGztrXE/VCZKaFgnOUI/AAAAAAAAAHo/dn14mvBr7lM/s1600/P1011547.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CuGM5lYJdZo/VCZKZblkCwI/AAAAAAAAAHk/TEhfW0oAet0/s1600/P1011551.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CuGM5lYJdZo/VCZKZblkCwI/AAAAAAAAAHk/TEhfW0oAet0/s1600/P1011551.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vnjk3z-3L5U/VCZKp_dCBaI/AAAAAAAAAH8/Um1Ae1hB1B8/s1600/P1011554.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vnjk3z-3L5U/VCZKp_dCBaI/AAAAAAAAAH8/Um1Ae1hB1B8/s1600/P1011554.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--6WgOoW5FV0/VCZKqzEQzQI/AAAAAAAAAIE/xYt3sEu9dJ0/s1600/P1011574.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--6WgOoW5FV0/VCZKqzEQzQI/AAAAAAAAAIE/xYt3sEu9dJ0/s1600/P1011574.JPG)  \n    \nHappy autumn!   \n    \n    \nInterested in more pumpkin recipes?

The point of the quiz was to demonstrate how differently people across the United States speak the English language. The quiz was scarily accurate... it identified my hometown and my parents' hometown as the places I'm most likely from. You should check out the [quiz at this link](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html?_r=0). One of the questions was how I pronounced \"caramel.\" Am I the only one who completely ignores the middle \"a\"? I say \"CAR-ml.\"  \n  \nAnyway, these cupcakes were a fun experiment for my husband's work luncheon. It was Harry Potter themed, so I wanted to go with something along the lines of butterbeer cupcakes. I adapted the cupcake recipe from [Natasha's Kitchen](http://natashaskitchen.com/2012/06/29/perfect-vanilla-cupcake-recipe/), and I invented the frosting recipe.  \n    \n### Caramel Cupcakes   \nYields: 15 cupcakes  \n  \n1 1/4 cups flour  \n1/2 tsp cornstarch  \n1 1/4 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1/2 tsp cinnamon  \n2 eggs  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n1 1/2 tsp vanilla  \n1/2 cup canola or veggie oil  \n1/2 cup buttermilk (I always use milk with 1/2 tsp white vinegar)  \n  \n1/3 cup caramel sauce (the ice cream topping kind is what I used)  \n  \n1\\. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Line cupcake pans with 15 cupcake papers. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk for about 1 minute. You want to get everything really well incorporated.  \n  \n2\\. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the eggs with the sugar for about 30 seconds. Add the vanilla and oil, then beat for 15 seconds.  \n  \n3\\. Add the flour mixture and buttermilk slowly, alternating between the two. Use a cookie scoop to divide the batter evenly among the 15 cupcake papers. I filled my cupcake paper halfway up the paper.  \n  \n4\\. Bake 12-14 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean.  \n    \n### Frosting  \n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter  \n2 tbsp caramel sauce  \n4 cups powdered sugar  \n1 tsp vanilla  \nmilk for thinning  \n  \n1\\. Beat the slightly softened butter for about 1 minute in the stand mixer. Add the caramel sauce.  \n  \n2\\. Slowly add the powdered sugar, then add the vanilla. You may need a few teaspoons of milk or cream to thin the frosting out enough to pipe it.  \n    \n### To assemble the cupcakes:  \nLet the cupcakes cool. Use a very small round piping tip to fill cupcakes with the caramel sauce. Pipe frosting onto the cupcakes using a closed star tip. Drizzle with leftover caramel sauce. Enjoy!  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nmSFlIDGWjo/VBxgXV0GqBI/AAAAAAAAAFY/hJd4wddusFI/s1600/P1011494.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nmSFlIDGWjo/VBxgXV0GqBI/AAAAAAAAAFY/hJd4wddusFI/s1600/P1011494.jpg)  \n    \n_My wonderful husband got me a fancy frosting piping bag and giant cupcake coupler for my birthday.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (365 for high altitude). Line mini cupcake tins with liners.   \n    \n2\\. Whisk together the cocoa powder and hot water. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.   \n    \n3\\. Melt the butter with the sugar in a saucepan on medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Pour the butter/sugar into a mixing bowl, and beat until it's cooled down, about 4 minutes.   \n    \n4. Add the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla, then the cocoa/water mixture. Add the flour mixture slowly, alternating with the sour cream.    \n    \n5\\. Scoop the batter using a small cookie scoop or spoon in into the cupcake liners. They should be about 3/4 full. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.   \n    \nOreo filling frosting  \n  \n1 stick butter, softened  \n3-4 cups powdered sugar  \n2 tsp vanilla  \npinch of salt  \n15 (ish) Oreo cookies  \n  \nScrape the filling out of all the Oreos. Keep the filling and crush the cookies. Beat the butter and the Oreo filling together with a mixer for about 1 minutes. Add the powdered sugar slowly, then the vanilla, and the pinch of salt. Beat for about 1 minute after it's all added to make sure it's all beat in and fluffy. Pipe onto the cupcakes with an open star tip, then roll them in the crushed Oreo pieces.  \n  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JTYxph0GH1o/U1aaUAHx2CI/AAAAAAAACeQ/pbuNK2SKHTE/s1600/P1011294.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JTYxph0GH1o/U1aaUAHx2CI/AAAAAAAACeQ/pbuNK2SKHTE/s1600/P1011294.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zVsgArsQC08/U1aaUV0fMAI/AAAAAAAACeY/p77k3eg-86Q/s1600/P1011295.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zVsgArsQC08/U1aaUV0fMAI/AAAAAAAACeY/p77k3eg-86Q/s1600/P1011295.JPG)  \n  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hzax3UfX3KM/U3vQc7qycoI/AAAAAAAAChc/AC_oINxCL3o/s1600/P1011281.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hzax3UfX3KM/U3vQc7qycoI/AAAAAAAAChc/AC_oINxCL3o/s1600/P1011281.JPG)"

I love cheesecake. We had to marry the two.   \n    \n(NOTE: Austin also likes cheesecake, and I also like brownies. Don't worry.)   \n    \n### Brownie Cheesecake  \nYields: 1 9\" cheesecake  \n  \n1 (18.4 oz) package brownie mix (I used Pillsbury Family Size Fudge Brownie Mix)  \n2/3 cup vegetable oil  \n1/4 cup water  \n5 eggs (divided use)  \n3 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened  \n1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n1/2 cup mini chocolate chips  \n  \nNote: The oil, water, and 2 of the eggs are for the brownie mix. If you're using a different brownie mix, you may need different amounts or ingredients to make your brownie mix.  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Spray the bottom of a 9\" springform pan with cooking spray.  \n  \n2\\. Prepare brownie mix with veggie oil, water, and 2 eggs. Pour the batter into the springform pan and bake for 35 minutes or until set.  \n  \n3\\. Beat cream cheese with a mixer until fluffy. Add three eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each egg. Beat in the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan on top of the brownie.  \n  \n4\\. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees fahrenheit. Bake the cheesecake for 50 minutes or until set (to check doneness-- tap the side of the springform pan with a wooden spoon. If the entire thing jiggles a lot, it needs a little more time. The center should jiggle when the cheesecake it done, but it shouldn't seem \"liquidy.\")  \n  \n5\\. To prevent cracking: When the cheesecake is done, crack the oven open for 5-10 minutes with the oven turned off before taking the cheesecake out.  \n  \n6\\. Refrigerate the cheesecake until set and cooled (at least 4 hours).  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O-XCO5_HG-g/U1aTE34z-YI/AAAAAAAACd0/zv3U4EZyIM8/s1600/P1011279.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O-XCO5_HG-g/U1aTE34z-YI/AAAAAAAACd0/zv3U4EZyIM8/s1600/P1011279.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7EI8TtjFOYs/U1aTD11eW_I/AAAAAAAACdc/8WX32aIrbWw/s1600/P1011252.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7EI8TtjFOYs/U1aTD11eW_I/AAAAAAAACdc/8WX32aIrbWw/s1600/P1011252.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fP_qhywi3Wk/U1aTE22Ga4I/AAAAAAAACd4/VsaEBH1QkrE/s1600/P1011274.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fP_qhywi3Wk/U1aTE22Ga4I/AAAAAAAACd4/VsaEBH1QkrE/s1600/P1011274.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FSZMwyoNOrI/U1aTDotikOI/AAAAAAAACdg/ugZrWxlSVEs/s1600/P1011264.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FSZMwyoNOrI/U1aTDotikOI/AAAAAAAACdg/ugZrWxlSVEs/s1600/P1011264.JPG)"

Luckily, Austin (my fiancé) loves sweets. We made Boston cream pie cupcakes recently and they were _so_ good.   \n    \n### Boston Cream Pie Cupcakes  \nYields: 18 cupcakes  \nRecipe from Women's Day Magazine  \n  \n**Cupcakes:**  \n2 1/2 cups flour  \n3/4 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened  \n1 1/4 cups sugar  \n3 eggs  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n1 cup buttermilk (or 1 cup milk + 1 tsp vinegar)  \n  \n**Filling:**  \n1 (3 oz) package Vanilla pudding (I used instant)  \n1 1/4 cups milk  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n  \n**Chocolate Glaze:**  \n8 oz semisweet chocolate chips  \n1/3 cup sugar  \n1/3 cup water  \n3 tbsp butter softened  \n    \nDirections:  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (365 for high altitude). Line cupcake pans with 18 cupcake liners.  \n    \n**Cupcakes**:  \n    \n2\\. Mix together dry cupcake ingredients except sugar (flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt). In a separate bowl, cream together butter and sugar for 3-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla and beat.   \n    \n3\\. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk to the butter/sugar mixture. Using a food scoop, evenly distribute the cupcake batter into the liners. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.   \n    \n**Filling:**  \n    \n4\\. Mix the pudding mix, milk, and vanilla together with a hand mixer until it thickens up (usually about 3 minutes). Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.   \n    \n**Glaze:**  \n    \n5\\. After the cupcakes are baked and cooled, use either a [knife](/2013/03/raspberry-white-chocolate-truffle.html) or a [cupcake corer](/2013/03/andes-mint-cupcakes.html), remove the center of your cupcakes to fill with the pudding. I put the pudding in a bag and cut the corner off to more easily fill them. Put the top of the cupcakes back on, then make the glaze.   \n    \n6\\. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine chocolate, sugar, and water. Stir until it's all melted, then remove from heat and add the butter. Stir until the butter is all melted, then spoon the glaze over your cupcakes.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HiHw5RvoV5w/U0Go869DpBI/AAAAAAAACcc/IjxSj8-iA1Q/s1600/P1011227.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HiHw5RvoV5w/U0Go869DpBI/AAAAAAAACcc/IjxSj8-iA1Q/s1600/P1011227.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ukgZJN0ov0M/U0MIJq0lCAI/AAAAAAAACdA/WlAT2OphyDo/s1600/P1011241.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ukgZJN0ov0M/U0MIJq0lCAI/AAAAAAAACdA/WlAT2OphyDo/s1600/P1011241.JPG)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UbkjwuWFnRU/U0GpEXDJypI/AAAAAAAACcs/wLi09ow6q_M/s1600/P1011244.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UbkjwuWFnRU/U0GpEXDJypI/AAAAAAAACcs/wLi09ow6q_M/s1600/P1011244.JPG)  \n    \nHappy Monday, everyone!"

Mix together the dry ingredients. Using either a food processor or a pastry cutter, cut butter and shortening into the dry ingredients.   \n    \n2\\. Once it resembles crumbles, slowly add the ice cold water. It may not take all of the water. Once it is sticking together, it's done!   \n    \n3\\. Form it into two discs, flattened out until they're about 1\" thick. Wrap each one in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.   \n  \nApple Pie  \n    \n10 apples (about 4 lbs), peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/4 inch slices  \n1/2 cup light brown sugar  \n1/4 cup granulated sugar  \n1 tsp ground cinnamon  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg  \n3 tsp cornstarch  \n1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  \n2 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces  \n1 egg, beaten with 1 tbsp milk  \n2 tsp granulated sugar  \n  \n1\\. In a large pot over medium-low heat, stir together apples, sugars, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cornstarch. Cook, covered, for 20 minutes.  \n  \n2\\. After about 20 minutes, take the top off, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 7-8 more minutes. Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice, and let it cool for 30 minutes.  \n  \n3\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.   \n  \n4\\. While the apples are cooling, roll out one of your pie crust dough discs on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out until it's about 13\" in diameter. Using the rolling pin, transfer the dough to your pie pan. Trim the edges, leaving at least 3/4\" overhang around the entire edge.  \n  \n5\\. Roll out your other pie crust dough disc until it's about 12\" in diameter. Cut it into 3/4\" strips with a pizza cutter.   \n  \n6\\. Pour your apple filling into the bottom pie crust. Dot with cold butter. Start with the middle strips to make the lattice. I used [this tutorial](http://www.butterbaking.com/2011/11/15/traditional-apple-pie/) to make my lattice. Press the outside overhang onto the edge.   \n  \n7\\. Beat the egg and milk. Brush it atop the dough on top. Sprinkle with sugar.   \n  \n8\\. Bake at 350 degrees fahrenheit for about 35-40 minutes, or until golden on top.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V2JXbywMQCY/Uov8tu0tpRI/AAAAAAAACYk/5IaHqffieXE/s640/IMG_5635.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V2JXbywMQCY/Uov8tu0tpRI/AAAAAAAACYk/5IaHqffieXE/s1600/IMG_5635.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3qOZ8PYiac/Uov8uzDQ9JI/AAAAAAAACYs/nsxz06B_Rbo/s640/IMG_5636.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3qOZ8PYiac/Uov8uzDQ9JI/AAAAAAAACYs/nsxz06B_Rbo/s1600/IMG_5636.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dk6oflTgiSE/Uov8xK3KtBI/AAAAAAAACY4/0itJAdbHG8I/s640/IMG_5644.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dk6oflTgiSE/Uov8xK3KtBI/AAAAAAAACY4/0itJAdbHG8I/s1600/IMG_5644.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kHLWf0a5lYc/Uov8vw5WGWI/AAAAAAAACYw/LaAKC0r5duQ/s640/IMG_5640.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kHLWf0a5lYc/Uov8vw5WGWI/AAAAAAAACYw/LaAKC0r5duQ/s1600/IMG_5640.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2_43-8w3Vi4/Uo1I6x21A3I/AAAAAAAACZE/9UchSA6_BDg/s640/IMG_5650.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2_43-8w3Vi4/Uo1I6x21A3I/AAAAAAAACZE/9UchSA6_BDg/s1600/IMG_5650.jpg)"

The holiday season is magical, and November is the real beginning of that season.   \n    \nI was craving cookies the other day. I didn't have any vegetable oil, so I texted my visiting teacher. She didn't have any veggie oil either, so I had to wait a few days to make the delicious cookies I wanted. **Torture. Absolute torture. **  \n    \nI wanted triple chocolate chip cookies. White chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate.   \n    \nI tweaked this recipe from [Lil Luna](http://lilluna.com/the-best-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe/).   \n    \n### Triple Chocolate Chip Cookies  \nYields: 3 dozen cookies  \n    \n1 cup brown sugar  \n1 cup sugar  \n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  \n1/2 cup vegetable oil  \n2 eggs  \n1 tsp baking soda  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1/4 tsp cornstarch   \n1 tsp salt  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n3 cups flour  \n1/2 cup white chocolate chips  \n1/2 cup milk chocolate chips  \n1/2 cup dark chocolate chips  \n    \n    \n1\\. Cream butter, oil, and sugars for 3-5 minutes.  \n    \n2\\. Add eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla. Mix together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl.  \n    \n3\\. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients slowly. Add the chocolate chips.   \n    \n4\\. Bake at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 7-8 minutes. I usually bake mine on a silpat or parchment paper.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zUZLtotxdjo/UnVp5js2FSI/AAAAAAAACX8/75v1zoIhoks/s640/P1011121.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zUZLtotxdjo/UnVp5js2FSI/AAAAAAAACX8/75v1zoIhoks/s1600/P1011121.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YdfgzxZro4s/UnVp53PkLOI/AAAAAAAACX4/KkoFnIWHHGs/s640/P1011125.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YdfgzxZro4s/UnVp53PkLOI/AAAAAAAACX4/KkoFnIWHHGs/s1600/P1011125.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DeZY3KCL0qs/UnVp5ssVc-I/AAAAAAAACXw/M-2oZuZJpC0/s640/P1011131.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DeZY3KCL0qs/UnVp5ssVc-I/AAAAAAAACXw/M-2oZuZJpC0/s1600/P1011131.JPG)"

He's great.   \n    \nThe leaves are covering the ground all around Provo and they make a very satisfying crunch when I step on them. It's time for pumpkin flavored everything.  \n    \nRecipe tweaked from [The Girl Who Ate Everything](http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2011/10/pumpkin-cream-cheese-muffins.html).  \n    \n### Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins  \nYields 24 muffins  \n    \n8 oz cream cheese (room temp)  \n1 cup powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp vanilla  \n    \n4 eggs  \n1 1/2 cups sugar  \n1 can pumpkin purée   \n1 1/4 cup vegetable oil  \n    \n3 cups AP flour  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n1 tsp nutmeg  \n1 tsp cloves  \n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice  \n1 tsp salt  \n1 tsp baking soda  \n    \n1/2 cup sugar  \n5 tbsp flour  \n1 1/2 tsp cinnamon  \n4 tbsp cold butter, cut into pieces  \n    \n1\\. Beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Set aside.   \n    \n2\\. Preheat oven to 350. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine eggs, sugar, pumpkin, and veggie oil.  \n    \n3\\. While that's beating, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Slowly add this to the wet ingredients.   \n    \n4\\. Using a food scoop, scoop batter about halfway up muffin papers in a muffin tin. Make small indents  in the batter and add about 1 tsp of the cream cheese mixture. Cover the cream cheese with about 1 tbsp more of the pumpkin batter.   \n    \n5\\. Using a pastry cutter, cut together sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter until it resembles crumbs. Sprinkle atop the unbaked muffins.  \n    \n6\\. Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.   \n    \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y-3lFpn6t3c/UmwlLkEOdDI/AAAAAAAACXE/tH1OayOARAg/s640/P1011088.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y-3lFpn6t3c/UmwlLkEOdDI/AAAAAAAACXE/tH1OayOARAg/s1600/P1011088.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pmh54hAChzM/UmwlqYTt_YI/AAAAAAAACXM/zMT4bBIepF0/s640/P1011095.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pmh54hAChzM/UmwlqYTt_YI/AAAAAAAACXM/zMT4bBIepF0/s1600/P1011095.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9wDVHlQiAvA/UmwlK_aMiLI/AAAAAAAACXA/uLvCe9qivFk/s640/P1011111.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9wDVHlQiAvA/UmwlK_aMiLI/AAAAAAAACXA/uLvCe9qivFk/s1600/P1011111.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

It's time for fall desserts.   \n    \nI can't wait for the leaves to turn colors. I love when the mountain is covered in the falling leaves.   \n    \nWhat better way to welcome autumn than by making an apple tart?  \n    \n### Puff Pastry Apple Tart  \nYields: 2 medium tarts (about 8 servings)  \n    \n1 sheet Pepperidge Farm puff pastry  \n2 large apples  \n1/4 cup brown sugar  \npinch of salt  \npowdered sugar for dusting  \ncreme fraiche   \n    \n1\\. Thaw out puff pastry. It's best to let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours before using it, but if you forgot, just leave it out of the freezer for 30 minutes before trying to unfold it.   \n    \n2\\. Preheat oven to 400 degreed fahrenheit.  \n    \n3\\. Peel, core, and slice apples into very thin slices. Put the sliced apples in a bowl and top with brown sugar and a pinch of salt. Stir it around. Let it sit for 5 minutes.  \n    \n4\\. Cut the puff pastry in half. Put it on a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper.   \n    \n5\\. Arrange the apples on the puff pastry, leaving about 1\" on the perimeter of the puff pastry so there will be a crust when it puffs up in the oven.   \n    \n6\\. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with creme fraiche.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bKeEcqVJyOs/UilVcsYtG1I/AAAAAAAACWI/k7K4Pjj5xNc/s640/P1011051.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bKeEcqVJyOs/UilVcsYtG1I/AAAAAAAACWI/k7K4Pjj5xNc/s1600/P1011051.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EONBBqBXgj0/UilVa89OYdI/AAAAAAAACWA/oreTh_BtB9E/s640/P1011037.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EONBBqBXgj0/UilVa89OYdI/AAAAAAAACWA/oreTh_BtB9E/s1600/P1011037.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4F7729bBBuc/UilVXci6rII/AAAAAAAACV4/0dX-FF_j2J4/s640/IMG_5322.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4F7729bBBuc/UilVXci6rII/AAAAAAAACV4/0dX-FF_j2J4/s1600/IMG_5322.jpg)  \n    \n    \nBon appétit!"

Back to the blog, and back to BYU!  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ILEvOPrDFI/UiJO4yq365I/AAAAAAAACUo/u7wIHT8PSvM/s640/IMG_5281.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ILEvOPrDFI/UiJO4yq365I/AAAAAAAACUo/u7wIHT8PSvM/s1600/IMG_5281.JPG)  \n    \n_My gorgeous roommates and crappy-yet-cute house_  \n    \nI forgot how much I love Provo. Seriously. Yesterday I went to SLAB Pizza (This awesome pizza place that gives you a quarter of a giant pizza and a drink for $5) and after I walked in, I saw _Stephanie Nielson_. I recently finished her book and I am in love with her story. She's one of the most inspiring people I've ever seen. You can see her story [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHDvxPjsm8E).   \n    \n    \nSo I've made this cake many times over the past few years. I'm not sure exactly when I discovered the recipe, but it's been a favorite for quite some time now.   \n    \nThe only reason I haven't blogged about it yet is because it's usually gone within an hour or two of baking it. Recipe tweaked from [Butter Yum](http://butteryum.blogspot.com/2011/01/to-die-for-banana-cake-with-vanilla.html).   \n    \n### Banana Cake  \nYields: 8x8 cake  \n    \n2/3 cup sugar  \n1/2 cup sour cream (or buttermilk)  \n1 egg  \n2 tbsp butter, softened  \n2-3 overly ripe bananas  \n1 tsp vanilla extract  \n1 cup flour  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1/4 tsp baking powder  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees (350 for glass pan) fahrenheit.  \n    \n2\\. Cream together sugar, sour cream, egg, and butter for about 3 minutes. Add mashed banana and vanilla and beat.   \n    \n3\\. Mix together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Add them slowly to the wet ingredients.  \n    \n4\\. Pour into a greased 8x8 pan and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the cake.   \n    \n### Brown Sugar Buttercream  \n1 stick butter, softened  \n1 cup brown sugar  \n1 cup powdered sugar  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 tbsp milk, optional   \n    \nIn a stand mixer, cream together the butter and the brown sugar for 5 minutes, or until most of the graininess of the sugar is dissolved. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla slowly. If the frosting is too thick, add milk slowly. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bFHnm_H3QcE/UiJKWrBmpWI/AAAAAAAACUA/rkcUkPGWikk/s640/P1010961.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bFHnm_H3QcE/UiJKWrBmpWI/AAAAAAAACUA/rkcUkPGWikk/s1600/P1010961.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FwjfavIoatY/UiJKXHHcSTI/AAAAAAAACUI/_25Wr9Km8EY/s640/P1010975.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FwjfavIoatY/UiJKXHHcSTI/AAAAAAAACUI/_25Wr9Km8EY/s1600/P1010975.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IUhJzRs48DE/UiJKZsUtIuI/AAAAAAAACUY/I5cVvKMbE_w/s640/P1010980.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IUhJzRs48DE/UiJKZsUtIuI/AAAAAAAACUY/I5cVvKMbE_w/s1600/P1010980.JPG)"

It's so good. It's the stuff of dreams. When a loaf of hot bread comes out of the oven, the first thing I do is reach for the raspberry jam. Bread and jam are one of the quintessential combinations in life.  \n  \nWe had 3 containers of raspberries in the fridge and I wanted to use them up so they wouldn't go bad. I had only tried to make jam once in my life before and [I had a bad experience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4_OJ2bciRc).  I made it so thick it wasn't even spreadable! That's hardly appetizing.  \n  \nI looked for a simple recipe. I found one that has 3 ingredients. Simple enough! Best part? NO PECTIN! That stuff is expensive!  \n    \n### Copycat Bonne Maman Raspberry Jam  \nYields: 2 pint jars or 4 half-pint jars  \n  \n4 cups raspberries  \n4 cups sugar  \n1 tbsp lemon juice  \n  \n1\\. Sterilize your jars, lids, and rims in simmering water.  \n  \n2\\. Put your raspberries in a 2 quart pot on medium high heat. Stir constantly. Let the juices come out and add sugar and lemon juice. Let it boil rapidly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.  \n  \n3\\. Ladle it into your jars, leaving 1/4 inch at the top of empty space. Put the lids on and return to hot water bath on high heat with at least 2 inches of water on top of the tops of the jars. Boil for 15 minutes and remove from the water.  \n  \n4\\. Let the jars sit out on the counter for 24 hours. If the tops on the jars popped in, they should be sealed correctly. They're good to sit out on the counter for up to 1 year!  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nqhe9BHvERs/UfHJyhqIJMI/AAAAAAAACOM/4Rju_qXA_08/s640/P1010707.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nqhe9BHvERs/UfHJyhqIJMI/AAAAAAAACOM/4Rju_qXA_08/s1600/P1010707.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-waobIXnC-yw/UfHJ0FoXKKI/AAAAAAAACOU/ZRvgV0MuK4Q/s640/P1010708.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-waobIXnC-yw/UfHJ0FoXKKI/AAAAAAAACOU/ZRvgV0MuK4Q/s1600/P1010708.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fJaF4kygODY/UfHJ138o3YI/AAAAAAAACOs/-j9eQ2WAay4/s640/P1010711.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fJaF4kygODY/UfHJ138o3YI/AAAAAAAACOs/-j9eQ2WAay4/s1600/P1010711.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h6k4cX-JFRo/UfHJ3rKG8II/AAAAAAAACO0/JNJ0Fuh78w0/s640/P1010718.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h6k4cX-JFRo/UfHJ3rKG8II/AAAAAAAACO0/JNJ0Fuh78w0/s1600/P1010718.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QzXwZRVjmEI/UfHJ5eFdDxI/AAAAAAAACPM/Ipf3JtUqpQ8/s640/P1010730.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QzXwZRVjmEI/UfHJ5eFdDxI/AAAAAAAACPM/Ipf3JtUqpQ8/s1600/P1010730.JPG)"

Don't worry, I plan on trying all of these combos.  \n  \nThis recipe hails from [Delia Creates](http://www.deliacreates.com/2010/10/best-bread-ever.html).  \n  \nSoft Sandwich Bread  \nYields: 2 9x5 loaves  \n  \n2 1/2 cups hot water  \n1/3 cup oil  \n1/3 cup honey  \n1 tbsp salt  \n6 3/4 cup flour  \n1 1/2 tbsp dry active yeast  \n  \n  \n1\\. Whisk together water, oil, honey, and salt.  \n  \n2\\. Add 3/4 cup flour and the yeast. Mix until it's mostly incorporated. Add half the remaining flour and knead in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. You don't necessarily have to use a stand mixer-- you can do it by hand. Just knead normally. Add the remaining flour and knead for about 5 minutes.  \n  \n3\\. Let rise in a greased bowl covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes in a warm place.  \n  \n4\\. Plop dough out onto a floured surface and divide in half. Roll each until it's 9 inches wide by about 30 inches long. Roll it up and put it into a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Let rise, covered, for 30 minutes in a warm place (or about 2 hours in the fridge if you want to slow down the rising time... I did this and it rose _beautifully_!)  \n  \n5\\. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when you tap the tops of the loaves.  \n  \n6\\. Optional: brush finished loaves with butter (This probably _shouldn't_ be optional because... butter)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dMB80CLSovk/Ufl21zgWmuI/AAAAAAAACQk/PD234SmDaLY/s640/P1010781.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dMB80CLSovk/Ufl21zgWmuI/AAAAAAAACQk/PD234SmDaLY/s1600/P1010781.JPG)  \n    \nAfter second rise  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OG9Jw51BXtc/Ufl22frpxTI/AAAAAAAACQs/MwvhNi7lqaw/s640/P1010791.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OG9Jw51BXtc/Ufl22frpxTI/AAAAAAAACQs/MwvhNi7lqaw/s1600/P1010791.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d05RX-qWsNs/Ufl21WIpK2I/AAAAAAAACQc/b9o_GqZA6K8/s640/P1010824.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d05RX-qWsNs/Ufl21WIpK2I/AAAAAAAACQc/b9o_GqZA6K8/s1600/P1010824.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zA1phXvLvx0/Ufl7ceNHV2I/AAAAAAAACRY/PcvVJC2ojcA/s640/P1010833.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zA1phXvLvx0/Ufl7ceNHV2I/AAAAAAAACRY/PcvVJC2ojcA/s1600/P1010833.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s5wxh1Dq84s/Ufl255nOmbI/AAAAAAAACRM/IuB1c-wl5p4/s640/P1010851.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s5wxh1Dq84s/Ufl255nOmbI/AAAAAAAACRM/IuB1c-wl5p4/s1600/P1010851.JPG)  \n    \nWith homemade raspberry jam... recipe coming soon!  \n    \nBon appétit!"

I wanted lemon cake. I like raspberries. This is the result.    \n###     \n### Lemon Sponge Cake  \n*   6 egg yolks\n*   1 1/2 cup sugar\n*   6 tablespoons lemon juice\n*   1 1/2 cup cake flour\n*   6 egg whites\n*   1 teaspoon baking powder\n*   1/4 teaspoon salt  \n\\[I halfed the recipe\\]  \n    \nBeat egg yolks with sugar until lightly colored. Alternate adding lemon juice and flour and mix until incorporated.  \n  \nBeat the egg whites in a separate bowl until they're stiff. Add baking powder and salt and beat until the egg whites hold a stiff peak.   \n  \nFold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Put into two greased and floured 9\" pans and bake at 325 for about 20 minutes.   \n  \nRemove from pan after cooling. Top with pastry cream and fresh raspberries.   \n  \n    \n### Pastry Cream  \n    \n*   From Martha Stewart\n    \n      \n    \n    1/2 cup sugar\n    \n    2 tbsp flour\n    \n    2 tbps cornstarch\n    \n    2 cups whole milk\n    \n    1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n    \n*   Beat egg yolks and sugar until they're lightly colored. Beat in flour and cornstarch. \n    \n      \n    \n    In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil, making sure to whisk constantly. Remove from heat and add the milk slowly into the egg mixture.\n    \n      \n    \n    Put the mixture back into the saucepan and bring it to a boil while whisking. Keep whisking and let it boil until it is thick (about 3 minutes). \n    \n      \n    \n    Remove from heat and return mixture to the mixer. Beat it with a paddle attachment. Add the vanilla and beat it for about 5-6 minutes, or until it's down to room temperature. Store it in the fridge to cool it down. \n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kZi0D88E6KA/Ue28xupdSEI/AAAAAAAACMQ/RytDRKEUp78/s640/P1010649.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kZi0D88E6KA/Ue28xupdSEI/AAAAAAAACMQ/RytDRKEUp78/s1600/P1010649.JPG)\n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v8I08g6mYkA/Ue28x7KSFtI/AAAAAAAACMc/GFLIokb5kOk/s640/P1010652.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v8I08g6mYkA/Ue28x7KSFtI/AAAAAAAACMc/GFLIokb5kOk/s1600/P1010652.JPG)\n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5j0iTleMucg/Ue280BXWDpI/AAAAAAAACMk/j8HjOQ3tcmU/s640/P1010660.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5j0iTleMucg/Ue280BXWDpI/AAAAAAAACMk/j8HjOQ3tcmU/s1600/P1010660.JPG)\n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kozMYqXINw/Ue280liQhRI/AAAAAAAACMs/zGpKFwoAmss/s640/P1010680.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kozMYqXINw/Ue280liQhRI/AAAAAAAACMs/zGpKFwoAmss/s1600/P1010680.JPG)\n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IcUm71Y6xqY/Ue281BbZcnI/AAAAAAAACM0/SLPWS4HfNuw/s640/P1010685.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IcUm71Y6xqY/Ue281BbZcnI/AAAAAAAACM0/SLPWS4HfNuw/s1600/P1010685.JPG)\n    \n      \n    \n    [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ivNUZgAd9fo/Ue282PaxvnI/AAAAAAAACM8/-HaaG2sISww/s640/P1010691.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ivNUZgAd9fo/Ue282PaxvnI/AAAAAAAACM8/-HaaG2sISww/s1600/P1010691.JPG)"

It tastes _almost_ like a sourdough to me, and it was so good. Also. . . it's the easiest bread ever. No knead?! Count me in!  \n    \nI really can't praise this bread highly enough. It's the Crusty Bread recipe from [Simply So Good](http://www.simplysogood.com/2010/03/crusty-bread.html) and it really _is that good_. I know that I can't even begin to do this bread justice, so I'll just give you the recipe.   \n    \n### Crusty French Bread  \nYields: 1 loaf  \n    \n3 cups unbleached all purpose flour  \n1 3/4 tsp salt  \n1/2 tsp active dry yeast (rapid rise)  \n1 1/2 cups water (room temp or a little warm will do)  \n    \n1\\. Mix together the flour, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir until it's all incorporated. It will be a sticky mess in the bowl.  \n    \n2\\. Let the bowl sit for 12-18 hours.   \n    \n3\\. Heat your oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit. Pour the dough out onto a _heavily_ floured counter. Cover the top with plastic wrap to let it rest for 30 minutes. While the dough is resting, put a cast iron skillet or casserole dish or le Creuset in the oven to heat up.   \n    \n4\\. Take the baking dish out of the oven and drop the dough into the bottom of the dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. After about 20 minutes, place a pan filled with water in the bottom of the oven and take the foil off of the bread. This will crisp the bread up.   \n    \n5\\. Take the bread out and let it cool on a cooling rack.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k1wn8GcKUUA/UerGlayc8NI/AAAAAAAACLI/Xl6zZNhkA7w/s640/P1010624.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k1wn8GcKUUA/UerGlayc8NI/AAAAAAAACLI/Xl6zZNhkA7w/s1600/P1010624.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HFOdyq9Kxnc/UerGlfbJc3I/AAAAAAAACLM/dxTLxtzPo5s/s640/P1010628.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HFOdyq9Kxnc/UerGlfbJc3I/AAAAAAAACLM/dxTLxtzPo5s/s1600/P1010628.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1OmkoL8NYTM/UerGldNbrZI/AAAAAAAACLE/lr8Svm9xDqQ/s640/P1010629.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1OmkoL8NYTM/UerGldNbrZI/AAAAAAAACLE/lr8Svm9xDqQ/s1600/P1010629.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--UHdjlG-5ik/UerGpBBURnI/AAAAAAAACLY/LwuuRIKLn40/s640/P1010634.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--UHdjlG-5ik/UerGpBBURnI/AAAAAAAACLY/LwuuRIKLn40/s1600/P1010634.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j_HueGouFxg/UerGpeAn6tI/AAAAAAAACLg/Iy2DLfv7JxI/s640/P1010638.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j_HueGouFxg/UerGpeAn6tI/AAAAAAAACLg/Iy2DLfv7JxI/s1600/P1010638.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

I ordered four tart pans, one madeleine pan, a mini cheesecake pan, and two baguette pans.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jleTjTbMONM/UemgzcduzAI/AAAAAAAACKo/o-mR8P9BHeA/s640/IMG_4982.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jleTjTbMONM/UemgzcduzAI/AAAAAAAACKo/o-mR8P9BHeA/s1600/IMG_4982.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pWO2Zi_alww/UemgyfcadoI/AAAAAAAACKg/JOOXE_YFhXA/s640/IMG_4984.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pWO2Zi_alww/UemgyfcadoI/AAAAAAAACKg/JOOXE_YFhXA/s1600/IMG_4984.jpg)  \n    \nIt was a _happy_ day, y'all.   \n    \n    \nI found [this recipe from Kelly Nixon](http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/kelsey-nixon/homemade-french-baguettes.html) that only takes 1 1/2 hours to make baguettes. It really only took me about **_an hour_**, because mine always rises faster than hers did. I've made this bread many times, using both a baguette pan and a baking sheet with a silpat.   \n    \nThis bread is really crispy on the outside and warm, dense, and soft on the inside.   \n    \n    \n**The secret making the bread have a crispy crust?**  \n**Ice.**  \n    \n    \nWhat?!  \n    \nYeah. Seriously. It works, you guys. It seems like steaming the bread should make the bread soggy, but it totally doesn't. It makes it crispy. Whoodathunkit?  \n    \n### Quick French Baguettes  \nYields: 2 baguettes  \n    \n1 1/2 tbsp active dry yeast  \n1 1/2 cups warm water (split)  \n2 tbsp honey  \n3 1/2 to 4 cups all purpose flour  \n2 tsp salt  \n5 ice cubes  \n    \n1\\. Combine honey with 1/2 cup warm water. Add the yeast and stir with your finger. Let it sit and activate for 5 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. Mix the flour and salt in a mixer. Add the water with the yeast and mix with the dough hook. Mix with the mixer for 1 minute, or until combined.  \n    \n3\\. Pour out of mixer bowl onto lightly floured surface. Knead for 2-6 minutes, or until elastic. Do the fingerprint test. If you can press your finger very lightly into the dough and the dough pops back out slowly, it is elastic enough. Put it back in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 25-30 minutes or until doubled in size.  \n    \n4\\. Punch down dough and divide in half. Shape into 2 baguettes by trifolding the dough (like you fold a letter). Pinch the seam closed and repeat the process twice until it's about 14 inches in length. Fold the ends round. Set in a [baguette pan](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/baguette-pan) or a lined cookie sheet (baking stone would probably work well too). Cover with a dish cloth and let rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.  \n    \n5\\. Preheat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit. Set an old (non-glass) baking dish on the bottom oven rack.   \n    \n6\\. When the rising is done and the oven is ready, quickly put the baguettes in the oven and throw the ice cubes into the old baking dish in the bottom. It should steam.   \n    \n7\\. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aisPm8vaByo/UeTYAS-jwJI/AAAAAAAACKI/oY01xXKYC3o/s640/P1010567.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aisPm8vaByo/UeTYAS-jwJI/AAAAAAAACKI/oY01xXKYC3o/s1600/P1010567.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YxJq0YoXz3k/UeTYAMhT-TI/AAAAAAAACKA/hlwGw2RalPQ/s640/P1010572.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YxJq0YoXz3k/UeTYAMhT-TI/AAAAAAAACKA/hlwGw2RalPQ/s1600/P1010572.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8xFUO1eaIBU/UeTYBpPHXJI/AAAAAAAACKQ/sIFFBpN8cyU/s640/P1010581.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8xFUO1eaIBU/UeTYBpPHXJI/AAAAAAAACKQ/sIFFBpN8cyU/s1600/P1010581.JPG)  \n    \nEnjoy with Nutella.  \n    \nBon appétit!"

Why do people even bake crunchy cookies?  \n  \nDid you know that brown sugar is the ingredient that keeps cookies chewy instead of crunchy?! I didn't know this.  \n  \nI don't really have anything else to say about these cookies except that they are _good_, y'all. They have very slightly crispy edges and the lemon and white chocolate work together beautifully.    \n### Lemon White Chocolate Chip Cookies  \nYields: 18-20 cookies  \n  \n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened  \n1/2 cup light brown sugar  \n1/4 cup dark brown sugar  \n1/4 cup white sugar  \n1 egg  \n1/2 tsp lemon juice  \n1 1/2 cups flour  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp salt  \nzest of 1 lemon  \n3/4 cup white chocolate chips  \n  \n1\\. Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and lemon juice and beat for about 1 more minute.  \n  \n2\\. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest. Add slowly to the butter/sugar mixture until just incorporated. Add in the white chocolate chips and mix until they're evenly distributed.  \n  \n3\\. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Scoop cookies out onto a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes \\[they will appear to be not done, but they will continue cooking after you take them out\\]. Let the cookies sit on the pan for 10 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h4wp-66C57M/UeTPtB0cyTI/AAAAAAAACJo/VdpE_RXwRaQ/s640/P1010544.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h4wp-66C57M/UeTPtB0cyTI/AAAAAAAACJo/VdpE_RXwRaQ/s1600/P1010544.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EM8muvCXbCo/UeTOtB6TtRI/AAAAAAAACJc/5WbijZXWRuY/s640/P1010561.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EM8muvCXbCo/UeTOtB6TtRI/AAAAAAAACJc/5WbijZXWRuY/s1600/P1010561.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

Barring the constant melting, that house would be SWEET (pun intended). You could eat anything you want, and the smell would be beyond your wildest dreams.    \n    \nThat, my dear friends, is how my house smells right now. My home is chocolate bliss right now.  \n    \nI decided to send a package to my sister who lives in San Francisco. I wanted to include in the package something baked and delicious for her to eat. She's been doing some weird Keto diet, but she's promised to abandon her diet for a day if I send something homemade.   \n    \nI made a mini pound cake to go with the big one so my family here would have something to taste. I feel like it's pretty cruel to bake something so fragrant and chocolatey and then just ship it all off without anyone here getting to try it. This pound cake is so good! The chocolate flavor is just so rich and deep. I tweaked the recipe from [Tutti Dolci](http://tutti-dolci.com/2013/04/chocolate-pound-cake/).   \n    \n### Chocolate Pound Cake  \n**Cream Cheese Ribbon**  \n3 oz cream cheese, softened  \n1 tbsp sour cream  \n1 tbsp sugar  \n1/4 tsp vanilla extract  \n**Batter**  \n1 1/4 cups flour  \n1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa  \n1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1/4 tsp baking soda  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n1 large egg  \n1 tsp vanilla extract  \n1/4 cup sour cream  \n3/4 cup buttermilk  \n2 tbsp mini semisweet chocolate chips  \n2 tbsp pecan pieces (optional)  \n  \n    \n    \nPreheat oven to 350°F and spray an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Combine cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla and beat until smooth.  \nWhisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in a large mixer bowl at medium speed until light and fluffy; beat in egg and vanilla. Combine sour cream and buttermilk in a small bowl. Reduce speed to low and add half of flour mixture, beating just to combine. Add sour cream mixture, then finish with remaining flour mixture.  \nPour half the batter into prepared pan; dollop with cream cheese mixture and swirl layers together with a knife or wooden skewer. Top with remaining batter and smooth with an offset spatula; sprinkle with chocolate chips and pecans, if desired. Bake for 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and cake springs back to the touch. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes; carefully remove cake from pan and cool completely on wire rack. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 3 days.  \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kp8OF2jxzjw/Ud8NUv4qC1I/AAAAAAAACHY/ySEPfC5a8hc/s640/P1010518.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kp8OF2jxzjw/Ud8NUv4qC1I/AAAAAAAACHY/ySEPfC5a8hc/s1600/P1010518.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PVc_-rDN470/Ud8ODzB0SDI/AAAAAAAACHo/YsL32gYRhaA/s640/P1010522.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PVc_-rDN470/Ud8ODzB0SDI/AAAAAAAACHo/YsL32gYRhaA/s1600/P1010522.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E-y5ugJTfn4/Ud8OUuory5I/AAAAAAAACH4/t3UiS7HONSA/s640/P1010529.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E-y5ugJTfn4/Ud8OUuory5I/AAAAAAAACH4/t3UiS7HONSA/s1600/P1010529.JPG)  \n    \n_There's the cream cheese ribbon!

By the time I baked the muffins around 3 pm, I had to practically pry my hands away from them so I wouldn't consume all of the muffins before my parents got any.   \n    \nI had pinned a banana crumb muffin recipe from Eat At Allie's many moons ago and I was itching to try it (isn't that phrase disgusting? I think it ranks somewhere between \"Keep your eyes peeled\" and \"[Party pooper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwofYhUJEM)\")  \n    \nWe had an obscene amount of cream cheese (Sam's Club, anyone?), so I wanted to add some cream cheese into the recipe. I thought of those delicious Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins that have been circling Pinterest for a while.   \n    \n### Banana Cream Cheese Muffins  \nYields: 12 Muffins  \n    \n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  \n1 tsp baking soda  \n1 1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n2 or 3 bananas, mashed  \n1/2 cup white sugar  \n1 egg, lightly beaten  \n1/3 cup butter, melted  \n    \n4 oz. cream cheese, softened  \n1 egg  \n1/4 cup powdered sugar  \n    \n4 tbsp sugar  \n4 tbsp flour  \n2 tbsp cold butter  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.   \n2\\. Beat bananas, sugar, egg, and butter together. Add the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Scoop with a cookie scoop into a muffin tin lined with muffin papers.   \n3\\. Beat cream cheese with egg and powdered sugar. Scoop about 1 tbsp of the cream cheese mixture on top of the muffin batter in each cup and swirl it a little bit with a knife.   \n4\\. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the butter into the sugar and flour. Sprinkle the crumble on top of each muffin cup.   \n5\\. Bake 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.   \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rW_ridgyWS4/UdILGS-TZjI/AAAAAAAACGM/-_oimFOt9OI/s640/P1010506.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rW_ridgyWS4/UdILGS-TZjI/AAAAAAAACGM/-_oimFOt9OI/s1600/P1010506.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R9mprQ8KXns/UdILek0WmkI/AAAAAAAACGU/Aft62Y3bT1Q/s640/P1010511.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R9mprQ8KXns/UdILek0WmkI/AAAAAAAACGU/Aft62Y3bT1Q/s1600/P1010511.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

I had heard that blueberry bushes grow really well in Texas, and since the plant was only about 8 bucks, I went for it.   \n    \nLast year, I didn't get to eat any of the blueberries. The squirrels or birds ate all of them. It was the saddest thing that's ever happened.  \n    \nYesterday, I went outside to find a few of the blueberries were ripe and delicious!  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--oveSLY1Wd8/UcSa_aQ9jTI/AAAAAAAACF0/ecVnUlPcWgM/s640/IMG_4884.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--oveSLY1Wd8/UcSa_aQ9jTI/AAAAAAAACF0/ecVnUlPcWgM/s1600/IMG_4884.jpg)  \n    \nThey're so blue!  \n    \nNow, I don't by any means have enough blueberries to make anything, but eating the few ripe blueberries on the bush made me crave blueberry muffins for breakfast this morning. I've made blueberry muffins many times before, but these are definitely the best. They're so good, y'all. I adapted the delicious recipe from the [Samson Family](http://www.sansomfamily.com/?p=2241).   \n    \n    \n### Blueberry Streusel Muffins  \n    \n1¾ cups flour  \n¾ teaspoon salt  \n¼ cup sugar  \n2½ teaspoons baking powder  \n1 1/2 cups blueberries (I used more like 2 cups-- hey, I like blueberries!)  \n1 large egg, at room temperature  \n¾ cup milk  \n1/3 vegetable oil  \n    \n1/4 cup flour  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n2 tbsp cold butter  \n    \n1\\. Sift the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder into a large bowl. Sprinkle over the blueberries. Beat the egg well then add the milk and oil and mix well together (don’t beat as this makes the muffins tough).  \n2\\. Scoop using a cookie scoop into buttered muffin tins or paper-lined muffin tins, filling the tins to the top.  \n3\\. Using a pastry cutter or a fork, cut the butter into the flour and sugar for the streusel topping. Cut until it resembles large crumbs.  \n4\\. Bake in an oven preheated to 425°F for 15-16 minutes, or until risen and golden. Remove from the oven, leave in the tray for 5 minutes, then flip out with a small knife onto a cooling rack.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CGV3m0BqfMI/UcSZ_2z3_dI/AAAAAAAACFo/3hm5xtCqIQw/s640/P1010466.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CGV3m0BqfMI/UcSZ_2z3_dI/AAAAAAAACFo/3hm5xtCqIQw/s1600/P1010466.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dQjOZhY-TQQ/UcSZ_NNseGI/AAAAAAAACFY/rKTLP8p5Ydc/s640/P1010485.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dQjOZhY-TQQ/UcSZ_NNseGI/AAAAAAAACFY/rKTLP8p5Ydc/s1600/P1010485.JPG)"

I pinned this recipe about 2 years ago, and I had been wanting to try it since then. I decided to try it tonight.   \n    \nBoy am I glad I did.  \n    \nIt was SO good.   \n    \nWe bought everything fresh just an hour before I made the pizza, so all of the toppings were wonderfully fresh and delicious.  \n  \nFrom [Seeded at the Table](http://www.seededatthetable.com/2011/01/24/chicago-style-deep-dish-pizza/).  \n    \n### Copycat Uno's Deep Dish Pizza  \nYields: 1 9\" deep dish pizza  \nTime: about 2 hours  \n    \nCrust:  \n    \n1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbsp AP flour  \n1/4 cup yellow cornmeal  \n3/4 tsp salt  \n1 tsp sugar  \n1 1/8 tsp instant yeast  \n1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp water, room temperature  \n1 1/2 tbsp butter, melted  \n    \n1 tsp olive oil  \n2 tbsp butter, softened  \n    \n2 cups shredded mozzarella   \nDesired toppings  \n    \n1\\. Whisk together the dry ingredients. Add the water and melted butter. With the dough hook attachment, turn the stand mixer on medium for 4-5 minutes, scraping the bowl as often as necessary. Put the dough in a bowl coated with the 1 tsp olive oil and let it rise at room temperature for 40-50 minutes, or until doubled.   \n    \n2\\. Roll the dough out to 6\"x8\". Spread the softened butter on the dough and fold the dough into thirds (like a business letter). Roll it out again, this time to 8\"x12\". Fold it into thirds again and then roll it into a ball. Put it into the bowl coated with olive oil and let it rise for 40-50 minutes in the fridge. While it's rising in the fridge, make the tomato sauce.  \n    \n    \nTomato Sauce:  \n    \n1 tbsp unsalted butter  \n2 tbsp grated onion  \nPinch of dried oregano  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1 clove garlic, minced  \n1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes  \nPinch of sugar  \n2 tbsp chopped basil leaves  \n1 1/2 tsp olive oil  \nBlack pepper, to taste  \nSalt, to taste  \n    \n3\\. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Sauté the onion and oregano in the butter for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add salt and garlic and cook for about 30 seconds before adding tomatoes and sugar. Let it come to a boil, then turn it down to a simmer for 15 minutes. Add the basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper, then remove from heat.   \n    \n4\\. Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit. Line the bottom of a 9\" deep dish pizza stone or a 9\" cake pan with 2 tsp cornmeal. Roll out the dough on a dry surface to about a 13\" circle. Transfer to pan. Line the dough with 2 cups shredded mozzarella. Top the cheese with the tomato sauce (how backwards! It keeps the crust from getting soggy) and then the desired toppings. I used pepperoni (a heck of a lot of 'em), bell peppers, tomatoes, bacon, mushrooms, italian meatballs, onions, and parmesan.   \n    \n5\\. Bake at 425 for 20-25 minutes. Let it sit out for 5-8 minutes before cutting and eating.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HxjUbRll1lQ/UbvGnKylsRI/AAAAAAAACEM/m_LFIKwfJVY/s640/P1010448.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HxjUbRll1lQ/UbvGnKylsRI/AAAAAAAACEM/m_LFIKwfJVY/s1600/P1010448.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qpQJUzPZbkc/UbvGnRdGUgI/AAAAAAAACEU/xK6-ApG5a48/s640/P1010453.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qpQJUzPZbkc/UbvGnRdGUgI/AAAAAAAACEU/xK6-ApG5a48/s1600/P1010453.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

I used to think they had to carve away at the frosting to make it look like that.  \n  \nThank goodness that isn't how it's done!  \n  \nOnce I learned how to frost cupcakes with piping tips, I never went back! It's about 503859 times easier than frosting with a knife, and it looks so professional. Easier **and** prettier? Count me in.  \n  \nI use five piping tips for frosting cupcakes.

They're so big and fresh. Yum!  \n  \nThe first time I tried a blueberry, I spat it out \\[I was about 4\\]. Now I can't get enough of 'em!  \n    \n### Blueberry Galette  \nYields: 9 inch galette  \n  \n1 recipe [Flakiest Pie Crust](/2012/11/the-perfect-pumpkin-pie-and-flakiest.html)  \n  \n3 cups fresh blueberries  \n3 tbsp flour  \n1/3 cup sugar  \n  \n1 egg  \nSugar for sprinkling  \n  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  \n  \n2\\. Roll out the raw pie crust dough to about a 13 inch circle. Don't try to make it perfect-- it just needs to roughly be a circle. Imperfection is what makes it a galette!  \n  \n3\\. Transfer the raw dough to a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper.  \n  \n4\\. Put the blueberries in a medium bowl. Top with flour and sugar. Mix so that all of the blueberries are coated. If you need to add more flour and sugar, do so.  \n  \n5\\. Put the coated blueberries in the center of the rolled-out dough and fold up the edges of the dough over the outer edges of the berries. Brush the beaten egg with a pastry brush on the dough that's folded up. Sprinkle the sugar on the egg washed dough.  \n  \n6\\. Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes, or until crust turns golden.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SRL8BB_M00c/UaKgZJIyVvI/AAAAAAAACAU/lRIXzu6tjcc/s640/P1010309.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SRL8BB_M00c/UaKgZJIyVvI/AAAAAAAACAU/lRIXzu6tjcc/s1600/P1010309.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cwTKQZs-C8I/UaKgYKFituI/AAAAAAAACAI/2a3hjrkpD6k/s640/P1010333.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cwTKQZs-C8I/UaKgYKFituI/AAAAAAAACAI/2a3hjrkpD6k/s1600/P1010333.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wh5VUz_N8qE/UaKgX8yKkiI/AAAAAAAACAE/YHckd5HCNyM/s640/P1010342.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wh5VUz_N8qE/UaKgX8yKkiI/AAAAAAAACAE/YHckd5HCNyM/s1600/P1010342.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

We fluently speak in movie quotes, ride elephants together, and eat ridiculous amounts of food from her family's catering business.   \n    \nI love that Haidyn is not at all a picky eater. She loves the weird food I like, so when I knew I'd be making her cupcakes for her birthday, I knew I could be as creative as I wanted to be.   \n    \nI wanted something with berries, and when I came home, there were some scrumptious-looking blackberries in the fridge that I just couldn't resist.   \n    \nWe had some lemons and I immediately knew I wanted a light lemony cupcake filled with sweetened mascarpone. The frosting would be lemony blackberry cream cheese buttercream topped with a blackberry. I love dreaming up cupcakes.   \n    \n### Lemon Cupcakes  \n### Yields 18-20 deliciously full-sized cupcakes  \n*   1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n*   1 cup cake flour (I used 1 cup minus 2 tbsp all purpose flour, then added 2 tbsp corn starch. This is my go-to cake flour recipe. Make sure to mix the flour and corn starch together really well.)\n*   1 teaspoon baking powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n*   1/2 teaspoon salt\n*   1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n*   1 cup sugar\n*   1 cup sour cream\n*   1/2 cup milk\n*   4 large egg whites, room temperature (I put my cold eggs soaking in warm water for 3 minutes or so)\n*   3 teaspoons lemon juice\n*   zest of one lemon  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 fahrenheit (If you're at high altitude, preheat to 385). Line cupcake tins with adorable cupcake liners.  \n  \n2\\. Mix together flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk until incorporated.  \n  \n3\\. In a medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, milk, and egg whites. **Set aside. **  \n4\\. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  \n  \n5\\. Add the vanilla extract to the butter mixture. While the mixer is on low, add the flour mixture in 3 parts alternating with the milk/sour cream mixture. (You'll start and end with flour mixture).  \n  \n6\\. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. (If you make mini cupcakes, they take about 13 minutes.)  \n    \n    \n### Mascarpone Filling  \n1/2 cup (4 oz) mascarpone cheese  \n1 cup powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp lemon juice  \n    \nBeat it all together and pipe into cupcakes.  \n    \n### Blackberry Cream Cheese Buttercream  \n4 oz cream cheese  \n6 tbsp butter  \n4 cups powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp clear vanilla extract  \n1 tsp lemon juice  \n1/4 cup blackberries plus some for topping  \n    \nHeat the blackberries in the microwave to help release the juices. Mash them through a sieve to get the seeds out. Beat the cream cheese and butter in a mixer. Add the powdered sugar until it's smooth. Add vanilla and lemon and beat until it's fluffy. Add the blackberry juice and make sure it's beaten until it's fully incorporated. Pipe onto cupcakes and top with a blackberry and some sugar crystal sprinkles.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XT47qvI6ePU/UYGb_zfQ26I/AAAAAAAAB38/I4zA4g5HyPs/s640/P1010094.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XT47qvI6ePU/UYGb_zfQ26I/AAAAAAAAB38/I4zA4g5HyPs/s1600/P1010094.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FvTwWMHgsao/UYGb_xW-SPI/AAAAAAAAB4A/GeXDD4_YlT0/s640/P1010096.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FvTwWMHgsao/UYGb_xW-SPI/AAAAAAAAB4A/GeXDD4_YlT0/s1600/P1010096.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rGgn18pADOI/UYGcARRAuXI/AAAAAAAAB4M/ts2c0EGgv7w/s640/P1010097.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rGgn18pADOI/UYGcARRAuXI/AAAAAAAAB4M/ts2c0EGgv7w/s1600/P1010097.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mv2SIVWf_v8/UYGcCGSfx2I/AAAAAAAAB4U/x0LrYvzjkgQ/s640/P1010099.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mv2SIVWf_v8/UYGcCGSfx2I/AAAAAAAAB4U/x0LrYvzjkgQ/s1600/P1010099.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DebZ-c0p7Ek/UYGcCWQB-6I/AAAAAAAAB4Y/mHaP-0GU_08/s640/P1010100.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DebZ-c0p7Ek/UYGcCWQB-6I/AAAAAAAAB4Y/mHaP-0GU_08/s1600/P1010100.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3XQmU6XI5Ew/UYGcDHjktGI/AAAAAAAAB4g/m5N9wAE-5f0/s640/P1010110.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3XQmU6XI5Ew/UYGcDHjktGI/AAAAAAAAB4g/m5N9wAE-5f0/s1600/P1010110.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yXX9ChCzY74/UYGcE0ZhquI/AAAAAAAAB4s/lfqhf2AVMzY/s640/P1010114.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yXX9ChCzY74/UYGcE0ZhquI/AAAAAAAAB4s/lfqhf2AVMzY/s1600/P1010114.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OtBHxRvjtNM/UYGcFGjpLlI/AAAAAAAAB40/2EkZ1AJ3iMs/s640/P1010116.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OtBHxRvjtNM/UYGcFGjpLlI/AAAAAAAAB40/2EkZ1AJ3iMs/s1600/P1010116.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZmKB8nKPo4/UYGcFUgoQsI/AAAAAAAAB44/C3DFJRRYn7Y/s640/P1010117.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZmKB8nKPo4/UYGcFUgoQsI/AAAAAAAAB44/C3DFJRRYn7Y/s1600/P1010117.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uaZPdphlmZ8/UYGcGPaPguI/AAAAAAAAB5E/T5-ctRXvvfE/s640/P1010133.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uaZPdphlmZ8/UYGcGPaPguI/AAAAAAAAB5E/T5-ctRXvvfE/s1600/P1010133.JPG)  \n    \n    \nBon appétit!"

It has a spicy, delicious scent and flavor that are enhanced when it's heated.    \n    \nWhen cinnamon is paired with sugar, the greatest invention (after butter), magical things happen. Babies laugh. Fireworks explode. Angels sing.  \n    \nAll of my favorite things come together in this cinnamon sugar pull-apart bread. It's buttery, cinnamony, and sugary. It pairs perfectly with cream cheese glaze.   \n    \n    \n### Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread  \nYields: 1 9x5 loaf  \n  \nDough:    \n2 3/4 cups flour (I used half bread flour and half AP flour)  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n4 tbsp butter  \n1/3 cup milk  \n1/4 cup water  \n2 eggs (room temperature)  \n1 tsp vanilla extract  \n  \n  \nFilling:  \n1 cup sugar  \n2 tsp cinnamon  \n1/2 tsp nutmeg  \n4 tbsp butter, melted  \n    \n\\*\\*\\*I just put all the dough ingredients in the bread machine and let it mix and rise\\*\\*\\*  \n    \n1\\. Whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.   \n    \n2\\. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and milk together. Once the butter is all melted together with the milk, remove from heat and add the water, vanilla, and eggs. Let it cool until it is pretty warm to the touch. Add this to the flour mixture and mix.   \n    \n3\\. Place in a greased bowl, covered and in a warm place, for 40-45 minutes.   \n    \n4\\. Mix the cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg in a small bowl.   \n    \n5\\. Once the dough is done rising, roll out on a lightly floured surface to be about 25x20. Spread the melted butter across the dough and then spread the cinnamon sugar mixture across. Cut into six strips then each of those into six squares.   \n    \n6\\. Put these squares in a greased 9x5 pan in small bunches to make it easier. Preheat oven to 350. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.   \n    \n7\\. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Eat it hot out of the oven! Enjoy with some [cream cheese drizzle glaze](/2013/04/auntie-annes-copycat.html).   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6rI_x0FIWPs/UX4EZsO7_jI/AAAAAAAAB3s/29tM13lc5yM/s640/P1019981.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6rI_x0FIWPs/UX4EZsO7_jI/AAAAAAAAB3s/29tM13lc5yM/s1600/P1019981.JPG)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wEfVTo1p3q0/UX3308xIUbI/AAAAAAAAB20/zNt583XGGfk/s640/P1019986.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wEfVTo1p3q0/UX3308xIUbI/AAAAAAAAB20/zNt583XGGfk/s1600/P1019986.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c4uXkQO9Qn4/UX336Q_UKgI/AAAAAAAAB28/ioQ3m0bO7nA/s640/P1019990.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c4uXkQO9Qn4/UX336Q_UKgI/AAAAAAAAB28/ioQ3m0bO7nA/s1600/P1019990.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RKRP-dixt_4/UX34IjE-6oI/AAAAAAAAB3M/4MG7tKrQoIw/s640/P1019991.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RKRP-dixt_4/UX34IjE-6oI/AAAAAAAAB3M/4MG7tKrQoIw/s1600/P1019991.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k2s_mEflZXE/UX34BHvBjII/AAAAAAAAB3E/DDZBdbQfCPA/s640/P1019992.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k2s_mEflZXE/UX34BHvBjII/AAAAAAAAB3E/DDZBdbQfCPA/s1600/P1019992.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KkRFH5-JjHw/UX34PJ_p_YI/AAAAAAAAB3U/aQs9nbdplQE/s640/P1019995.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KkRFH5-JjHw/UX34PJ_p_YI/AAAAAAAAB3U/aQs9nbdplQE/s1600/P1019995.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5-zbT2efPMU/UX34QF42G4I/AAAAAAAAB3c/8wB1OcH3X9I/s640/P1019998.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5-zbT2efPMU/UX34QF42G4I/AAAAAAAAB3c/8wB1OcH3X9I/s1600/P1019998.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6g5MU5CpWzI/UX33TvnVXzI/AAAAAAAAB2M/DVzipbH0pBo/s640/P1010013.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6g5MU5CpWzI/UX33TvnVXzI/AAAAAAAAB2M/DVzipbH0pBo/s1600/P1010013.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AWY_rMW0Gbw/UX33ZK6heuI/AAAAAAAAB2U/dsHXT0ttuPE/s640/P1010019.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AWY_rMW0Gbw/UX33ZK6heuI/AAAAAAAAB2U/dsHXT0ttuPE/s1600/P1010019.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6OzlgQWzrOY/UX33uwDY4KI/AAAAAAAAB2s/IP7yRK-hjYE/s640/P1010032.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6OzlgQWzrOY/UX33uwDY4KI/AAAAAAAAB2s/IP7yRK-hjYE/s1600/P1010032.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xBRtgZ2u-t4/UX33oVH6M_I/AAAAAAAAB2k/8uX3gVfdiq4/s640/P1010040.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xBRtgZ2u-t4/UX33oVH6M_I/AAAAAAAAB2k/8uX3gVfdiq4/s1600/P1010040.JPG)"

I've found recipes that make perfectly acceptable warm cookies, although admittedly when they would cool down they were usually a little crunchier than I wanted. I've always made cookies that were good with milk and all that... but they just weren't perfect.  \n  \nBut don't worry, because I have made the _perfect chocolate chip cookie_.  \n  \nThese cookies are unbelievably chewy and they stay that way for days! The only reason they lasted that long is I'm the only person left in my apartment.  \n  \n_The secret to keeping them chewy for days?_  \n  \nCornstarch!  \n  \nWhooda thunk it?  \n  \nAlso, for those of you who have asked, the secret to preventing cookies from sticking is using a **silicone baking liner.** You can get them just about anywhere. I always leave it in my cookie sheet, because it makes the bottom of everything perfectly golden and never burn!! It's magic.   \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis recipe is seriously foolproof. It was so simple. I'm eating one right now and I'll probably eat about 3 more in the process of writing this post. Foodie probs. This recipe is from [Sally's Baking Addiction](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/08/06/the-chocolate-chip-cookie/).   \n  \n    \n### Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies  \nYields: 3 dozen scrumptious cookies  \n    \n*   3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) butter, softened\n*   3/4 cup brown sugar\n*   1/4 cup sugar\n*   1 large egg, at room temperature\n*   2 tsp vanilla extract\n*   2 cups all-purpose flour\n*   2 tsp cornstarch\n*   1 tsp baking soda\n*   1/2 tsp salt\n*   1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, (I put Andes Mints in mine, and I've also done crushed up Oreos)  \n    \nIn a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until it's light and fluffy. Taste a little. That's the best stuff in the whole world. Mix in the egg and the vanilla and scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.   \n    \nIn a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients (don't add the chocolate chips yet). Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients slowly until it's incorporated. Add the chocolate chips, or whatever you want, really!   \n    \nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (It's worth it-- they come out in better shape and texture).   \n    \nDrop in 1 tablespoon scoops on a cookie sheet lined with silpat or parchment paper. Bake at 350 for 8-9 minutes and DO NOT BAKE THEM FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES or you will regret it and be sad forever. They may look like they're not done, but they are! I promise!  \n    \nEat all you can, and if there are any left, store them in an airtight container for up to 10 days. I doubt they'll last that long!  \n    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hzDVLYb18ko/UXdv85Cg1xI/AAAAAAAAB1A/ay00zBw9eZo/s640/P1010056.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hzDVLYb18ko/UXdv85Cg1xI/AAAAAAAAB1A/ay00zBw9eZo/s1600/P1010056.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3K4HYdKtcIg/UXdv_B8-llI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/EEIoX8JYRE8/s640/P1010080.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3K4HYdKtcIg/UXdv_B8-llI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/EEIoX8JYRE8/s1600/P1010080.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9RmT_HKgf1c/UXdv-HRAtzI/AAAAAAAAB1I/vsGOMNFMN5Q/s640/P1010077.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9RmT_HKgf1c/UXdv-HRAtzI/AAAAAAAAB1I/vsGOMNFMN5Q/s1600/P1010077.JPG)  \n    \n### [I made a new post about Cranberry White Chocolate Chip Cookies!](/2013/05/cranberry-white-chocolate-chip-cookies.html)  \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vXVoVuw9Lsk/UYWdlxqEb0I/AAAAAAAAB9M/eOurz4KWGks/s640/WM+Cran+WChoc+cookies.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vXVoVuw9Lsk/UYWdlxqEb0I/AAAAAAAAB9M/eOurz4KWGks/s1600/WM+Cran+WChoc+cookies.JPG)"

The worst and best week of the entire semester. It's the best because at BYU we get two \"reading days\" where we're supposed to study (I'll let you guess how much studying actually goes on...) I had some raspberries leftover and I wanted to make muffins.  \n  \nMuffins are really great. Have I ever told you that? They're like little mini cakes you can eat for breakfast without anyone judging you. They're beautiful. They usually have yummy berries or chocolate chips in them. Delectable.  \n  \nWhen you eat a cupcake, everyone knows you're eating dessert, but when you have a muffin somehow it becomes more acceptably healthy. Hey, I'm not complaining. These muffins were exactly what I needed to relieve my finals stress.  \n  \nI also bought a giant thing of bubble wrap at Walmart to relieve the rest of my stress. It's working. I'm essentially stress-free and I only have one final left. What a beautiful finals week!  \n    \n### Lemon Raspberry Muffins  \nYields: 18 muffins  \n    \n    \n2 cups all-purpose flour  \n1 cup sugar  \n1 tablespoon baking powder  \n1/2 teaspoon salt  \n2 eggs, lightly beaten  \n1 cup buttermilk (1 cup milk + 1 tsp vinegar)  \n1/2 cup veggie oil  \n1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  \n1 1/4 cups raspberries  \n    \n1 cup powdered sugar  \n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  \n    \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.   \n    \n2\\. Combine dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, salt) in a large bowl.   \n    \n3\\. In a separate bowl, beat eggs, buttermilk, oil, and lemon zest. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Gently fold in the raspberries.   \n    \n4\\. Scoop the batter into 18 muffin papers or sprayed muffin tins 2/3 full and bake for 18-20 minutes.   \n    \n5\\. Whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice and dip warm muffin tops in the glaze and let it harden slightly for about 3 minutes before eating.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BlvhKs3W7_I/UXbMoCMmkMI/AAAAAAAABzo/RUZf6ElY9uA/s640/P1019906.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BlvhKs3W7_I/UXbMoCMmkMI/AAAAAAAABzo/RUZf6ElY9uA/s1600/P1019906.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mbLpXb4L3t0/UXbMoEBTagI/AAAAAAAABzk/13OfJm6CQHA/s640/P1019915.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mbLpXb4L3t0/UXbMoEBTagI/AAAAAAAABzk/13OfJm6CQHA/s1600/P1019915.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zsJJJh0_XwU/UXbMn9zUibI/AAAAAAAABzs/J4jjNqaUqd0/s640/P1019930.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zsJJJh0_XwU/UXbMn9zUibI/AAAAAAAABzs/J4jjNqaUqd0/s1600/P1019930.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WXKneVqrAFk/UXbMthDIIrI/AAAAAAAABz8/6UgjKZ0kQlw/s640/P1019948.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WXKneVqrAFk/UXbMthDIIrI/AAAAAAAABz8/6UgjKZ0kQlw/s1600/P1019948.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

We would make huge batches so we had enough for the whole week. We always used the Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread. If you've never made french toast using cinnamon swirl bread, you haven't lived!  \n  \nThis week I tried out making cinnamon swirl bread from scratch, and it was so wonderful! I told my mom I'm bringing my bread machine home this summer so I can make this bread all summer for my parents.  \n  \nYou don't by any means have to have a bread machine to make this. I've included the directions for making the bread with and without the bread machine. All the bread machine does for me is knead and give me a warm place to let it rise. A kitchenaid mixer would work just as well, and I'm sure you could even mix it by hand!  \n  \nI altered this recipe from [LilLuna](http://lilluna.com/cinnamon-bread-recipe/).    \n### Best Cinnamon Swirl Bread  \nYields: 1 loaf  \n  \n1 1/2 tsp salt  \n1/3 cup brown sugar  \n2 tbsp margarine  \n3/4 cup hot water  \n3/4 cup cold water  \n1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast  \n4 cups bread flour (the original recipe calls for AP flour but I used bread flour)  \n  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n2 tbsp cinnamon  \n  \n1\\. Mix the salt, brown sugar, margarine, hot water, cold water, and active dry yeast together. Let the yeast proof for about 8 minutes.  \n  \n2\\. Add the flour and knead for 6-8 minutes. Put it in a greased bowl and let it rise for 1 1/2 hours.  \n  \n3\\. Mix cinnamon and sugar. Roll out the dough to be as wide as the loaf pan you're putting it in and as long as you can reasonably make it. Spray with a little bit of water or spread about 1 tbsp of butter across the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar all over and roll it up. Put it in a greased pan and let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm place.  \n  \n4\\. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until golden on top.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KSxwrbIGQvI/UWtjQN6cNOI/AAAAAAAABvw/u9UvA6pZXzk/s640/P1019853.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KSxwrbIGQvI/UWtjQN6cNOI/AAAAAAAABvw/u9UvA6pZXzk/s1600/P1019853.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Gg6B7sOk50/UWtjeH6eSQI/AAAAAAAABwA/ec0CZA9iuqs/s640/P1019863.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Gg6B7sOk50/UWtjeH6eSQI/AAAAAAAABwA/ec0CZA9iuqs/s1600/P1019863.JPG)  \n    \nBon appétit!"

My mom and I always joked that we _have_ to get Cinnamonster cinnamon rolls when we go to the mall because they're calling our names (\"Nea...Nea...\"). Another favorite of ours is the cinnamon sugar Auntie Anne pretzel, which comes coated in butter, then dipped in cinnamon sugar. My mom and I say, \" Okay, we each get half,\" and then we would both secretly try to get more than half (or at least I did). I do remember that my mom always gave me the last bite, which is why I love her (among other reasons).  \n  \nAs a college student, I don't get to go to the mall often, so I had to find out a way to make these pretzels without having a car to get to the mall. I looked online and found a recipe that I tweaked from The Well-Traveled Wife.  \n  \nY'all. I was really worried with the baking soda bath for these that they would end up being like those weirdo bagel-texture soft pretzels, and don't even act like you don't know what I'm talking about! Those bagely soft pretzels are _icky_!  \n  \nThis recipe makes super soft cinnamon sugar pretzels (or you could skip the cinnamon sugar and replace it with coarse salt) and cream cheese dipping sauce. I'm in love with this recipe.  \n  \n  \nI'm afraid it will bring on the freshman 15 in just the last two weeks of my freshman year.  \n  \n    \n### Auntie Anne's Copycat Soft Pretzels   \nYields 6-8 large pretzels, or you could honestly probably make them HALF the size I did, so it could make about 14-16 small pretzels  \n  \n1 1/2 cups warm water  \n1 1/4 tsp active dry yeast  \n2 tbsp light brown sugar  \n1 1/4 tsp salt  \n4 cups bread flour (original recipe calls for 1 cup bread flour + 3 cups AP flour)  \n  \n2 cups really warm water  \n2 tsp baking soda  \n  \n5 tbsp melted butter  \nabout 1/3 cup sugar  \nabout 1 tbsp cinnamon  \n  \n  \n1\\. Activate the yeast in the water for 5-10 minutes. Add the sugar and salt and mix. Add the flour and knead until elastic (7 ish minutes). I honestly just threw everything in the bread machine and to knead it for me, then I put it in a bowl in a warm oven (170 degrees fahrenheit) for 30 minutes or until it doubled. While it's rising, mix the warm water with the baking soda and stir until it dissolves. Put it in a dish that's shallow but still has sides so you're not spilling everywhere.  \n  \n2\\. Pinch off a fist of dough and roll it into a 1/2 inch thick snake-- don't roll it out! Roll it into snakes! [Slithery snakes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti4sqG85FU4)!  \n  \n3\\. Twist it up so it looks somewhat pretzel-like and then dip it in the baking soda water mixture. Put it on a greased or silpat-lined cookie sheet. Repeat with all the dough and let it rise for about 20-30 more minutes in a warm place. I put them on top of my oven while it was heating up.  \n  \n4\\. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes.  \n  \n5\\. Dip the pretzels in butter, then in cinnamon sugar.  \n    \n### Cream Cheese Dipping Sauce  \n3 oz cream cheese  \n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar  \n2 tbsp milk  \n2 tsp vanilla  \n    \n[Beat it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym0hZG-zNOk)   \n    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hJ0vtA-voYM/UWcxbGGSEVI/AAAAAAAABug/-7MZjRs779M/s640/P1019787.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hJ0vtA-voYM/UWcxbGGSEVI/AAAAAAAABug/-7MZjRs779M/s1600/P1019787.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-56ZDUVSSAhk/UWcxbAqhV4I/AAAAAAAABuo/iYTIzb3s250/s640/P1019791.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-56ZDUVSSAhk/UWcxbAqhV4I/AAAAAAAABuo/iYTIzb3s250/s1600/P1019791.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FKMoUVl5uGM/UWcxchwRxlI/AAAAAAAABvA/5Pxx4amcNlk/s640/P1019792.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FKMoUVl5uGM/UWcxchwRxlI/AAAAAAAABvA/5Pxx4amcNlk/s1600/P1019792.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xxp3M6FAR4E/UWcxcVTj0OI/AAAAAAAABu4/MPHMJbK4y7g/s640/P1019796.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xxp3M6FAR4E/UWcxcVTj0OI/AAAAAAAABu4/MPHMJbK4y7g/s1600/P1019796.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S7zE0CJY1oY/UWcxcs1gELI/AAAAAAAABu8/Qb-0OCKRs1A/s640/P1019797.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S7zE0CJY1oY/UWcxcs1gELI/AAAAAAAABu8/Qb-0OCKRs1A/s1600/P1019797.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6ms6uwJvQnY/UWcxdRLfGOI/AAAAAAAABvI/uBlp3U9KCh8/s640/P1019807.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6ms6uwJvQnY/UWcxdRLfGOI/AAAAAAAABvI/uBlp3U9KCh8/s1600/P1019807.JPG)  \n    \n_Bon appétit!_"

We really like holidays around here.   \n    \nI decided to bake cupcakes for Jenna's birthday so we could all have something sweet, because what is a birthday without eating way too much and feeling sick afterward?  \n    \n    \n### Perfect Chocolate Cupcakes  \n    \nYields: 18 cupcakes  \n*   1 cup flour (I used 1 1/4 cups because I'm at high altitude)\n*   3/4 cup sugar\n*   1/2 tsp baking powder\n*   1 tsp baking soda\n*   1/2 tsp salt\n*   1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n*   1/2 cup oil (I used veggie oil)\n*   1 cup hot water\n*   1 egg\n*   1 1/2 tsp vanilla  \n    \n    \n    \n1\\. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and the wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet while mixing. That's it! You could even probably do it all in one bowl at once (that's what the original recipe did). I mixed it by hand and it was super easy!  \n    \n    \n    \n2\\. Fill baking cups 2/3 of the way for sea level or 1/2 way for high altitude. Bake at 350 for about 12-15 minutes for full-sized or 9-11 for mini cupcakes.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hm1SlJTd8xk/UWS7X9X535I/AAAAAAAABtc/n9HQXcV2iYQ/s640/P1019737.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hm1SlJTd8xk/UWS7X9X535I/AAAAAAAABtc/n9HQXcV2iYQ/s1600/P1019737.JPG)  \n    \n### White Cupcakes  \nYields 18-20 deliciously full-sized cupcakes    \n*   1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n*   1 cup cake flour (I used 1 cup minus 2 tbsp all purpose flour, then added 2 tbsp corn starch. This is my go-to cake flour recipe. Make sure to mix the flour and corn starch together really well.)\n*   1 teaspoon baking powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n*   1/2 teaspoon salt\n*   1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n*   1 cup sugar\n*   1 cup sour cream\n*   1/2 cup milk\n*   4 large egg whites, room temperature (I put my cold eggs soaking in warm water for 3 minutes or so)\n*   3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 fahrenheit (If you're at high altitude, preheat to 385). Line cupcake tins with adorable cupcake liners.  \n  \n2\\. Mix together flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk until incorporated.  \n  \n3\\. In a medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, milk, and egg whites. **Set aside. **  \n4\\. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  \n  \n5\\. Add the vanilla extract to the butter mixture. While the mixer is on low, add the flour mixture in 3 parts alternating with the milk/sour cream mixture. (You'll start and end with flour mixture).  \n  \n6\\. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. (If you make mini cupcakes, they take about 13 minutes.)  \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sI9Gr0AaGEE/UWS75pNgOcI/AAAAAAAABtk/HxmMzOLT_RE/s640/P1019745.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sI9Gr0AaGEE/UWS75pNgOcI/AAAAAAAABtk/HxmMzOLT_RE/s1600/P1019745.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UyF_kTjPJRc/UWS6kkb4sII/AAAAAAAABtM/mz9fXZ3in-U/s640/P1019759.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UyF_kTjPJRc/UWS6kkb4sII/AAAAAAAABtM/mz9fXZ3in-U/s1600/P1019759.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2otNqSRqDtw/UWTrmrX8vZI/AAAAAAAABt8/MMEIype0YKg/s640/P1019772.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2otNqSRqDtw/UWTrmrX8vZI/AAAAAAAABt8/MMEIype0YKg/s1600/P1019772.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3i8NJcowXoM/UWTrmSh63LI/AAAAAAAABt4/cJdyt-HClzQ/s640/P1019777.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3i8NJcowXoM/UWTrmSh63LI/AAAAAAAABt4/cJdyt-HClzQ/s1600/P1019777.JPG)  \n    \nHappy Birthday, Jenna!  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KI0ZZP9NtsM/UWS6_G7R1UI/AAAAAAAABtU/0RF2Uoisszs/s640/P1019732.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KI0ZZP9NtsM/UWS6_G7R1UI/AAAAAAAABtU/0RF2Uoisszs/s1600/P1019732.JPG)"

This conference, I got to SING IN THE CHOIR for the Saturday afternoon session! It was the most incredible experience. The general authorities were so close, their priesthood was almost tangible.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4W9FgIM8vc0/UWHx4kGln9I/AAAAAAAABrI/TyBbV80dtQ0/s640/IMG_4418.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4W9FgIM8vc0/UWHx4kGln9I/AAAAAAAABrI/TyBbV80dtQ0/s1600/IMG_4418.JPG)  \n    \n_My close up_  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B628BNmM6FY/UWHx51I8o3I/AAAAAAAABrQ/BoO4fxzt57A/s640/Screen+Shot+2013-04-06+at+5.54.29+PM.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B628BNmM6FY/UWHx51I8o3I/AAAAAAAABrQ/BoO4fxzt57A/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-04-06+at+5.54.29+PM.png)  \n    \n_Oh, hey. _  \n    \n    \nConference is such a special weekend. I wanted to start my own tradition of making a special breakfast on the morning of conference. I asked my roommates what I should make and they all answered at once, \"Cinnamon rolls!\"  \n    \nOne does not simply say no to making cinnamon rolls.   \n    \nThese cinnamon rolls are très délicieux!  \n    \nThere's only one cinnamon roll left after 5 hours. All I'm saying here is that there are only 3 of us home this weekend and the recipe made 16... That's all I'm saying.   \n    \nI've made a Cinnabon clone recipe before, but I'll admit that this one trumps my old recipe. I love finding new, better recipes! I made this one in my bread machine and it worked out beautifully. The original recipe was made with a stand mixer, I believe.  \n  \nIn case you haven't noticed, I'm kind of in love with my bread machine. Adapted from [Lauren's Latest](http://www.laurenslatest.com/my-cinnabon-cinnamon-rolls/).  \n    \n### Cinnabon Clones  \nYields: 16 large rolls  \n  \n3/4 cup warm water  \n1/3 cup veggie or canola oil  \n1 egg  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n1/4 cup buttermilk (room temp)  \n1 tsp salt  \n4 1/2 cups flour  \n2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast  \n  \n1/2 cup softened butter  \n1 1/4 cups light brown sugar  \n3 tbsp cinnamon  \n2 tbsp cornstarch  \n  \n3 oz cream cheese, room temp  \n1/4 cup softened butter  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1 tsp lemon juice  \n1 1/4 cups powdered sugar  \n  \n  \nDirections  \n  \nAdd dough ingredients into the bread machine in the order prescribed by the bread machine instructions. I added them in the order I listed above. I put it on the dough cycle and it rose on its own.  \n  \nTake the dough out and put it onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to 30x20 inch rectangle.  \n  \nBeat the softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch together until it's light and fluffy. Spread this all over the rectangle of dough. Roll it up so that it's a 30-inch log. Cut it every 2 inches with dental floss.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-foDNMJG8diA/UWH6-kFzHVI/AAAAAAAABsA/8pFgyRBYI_w/s640/IMG_4415.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-foDNMJG8diA/UWH6-kFzHVI/AAAAAAAABsA/8pFgyRBYI_w/s1600/IMG_4415.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mf59Cafzr0g/UWH6-u0p6KI/AAAAAAAABsE/k6KNirqDGic/s640/IMG_4414.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mf59Cafzr0g/UWH6-u0p6KI/AAAAAAAABsE/k6KNirqDGic/s1600/IMG_4414.jpg)  \n    \nPut them in a greased pan (I used a 7x11 and a 6 inch round pan to accommodate all the rolls) and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled (about an hour) _**or**_ refrigerate overnight and then take out 3-4 hours before baking to let them rise.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pqYnHLiHBIM/UWHl5pWUQxI/AAAAAAAABqk/dJF0FIIxm_Q/s640/P1019706.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pqYnHLiHBIM/UWHl5pWUQxI/AAAAAAAABqk/dJF0FIIxm_Q/s1600/P1019706.JPG)  \n    \nBake at 350 for 17-18 minutes, or until the tops _just_ start to turn golden. _Don't_ let them over-bake!  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PjUKxKWor0E/UWHl4_BAIvI/AAAAAAAABqY/l3ekc3wkUKQ/s640/P1019713.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PjUKxKWor0E/UWHl4_BAIvI/AAAAAAAABqY/l3ekc3wkUKQ/s1600/P1019713.JPG)  \n  \nBeat all the frosting ingredients together until incorporated.  \n  \nLet the rolls cool for about 5 minutes before frosting.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0dTw1lL52eY/UWHl48huR_I/AAAAAAAABqg/L1dqdQltX9Q/s640/P1019715.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0dTw1lL52eY/UWHl48huR_I/AAAAAAAABqg/L1dqdQltX9Q/s1600/P1019715.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rKM2yjT4GeQ/UWHl6afcd7I/AAAAAAAABqs/C54EF3KfhqE/s640/P1019723.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rKM2yjT4GeQ/UWHl6afcd7I/AAAAAAAABqs/C54EF3KfhqE/s1600/P1019723.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSB9rBlwteM/UWHl75sfx4I/AAAAAAAABrE/oaV9abULy04/s640/P1019727.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSB9rBlwteM/UWHl75sfx4I/AAAAAAAABrE/oaV9abULy04/s1600/P1019727.JPG)  \n    \nThe last one _may_ or _may not_ have been consumed in the process of writing this blog post."

I love waking up and feeling absolutely free for a whole day. Now that it's finally spring here in Provo, we can actually do fun outside-y stuff.

It's an amazing view of most of the valley (did I mention I got a _horrible_ sunburn?)  \n  \nAfter one of the busiest weeks of my life, I finally had the Saturday that I needed. This week I planned the Relief Society birthday party, for which I baked 216 cupcakes and made enough buttercream frosting for all of those.  \n  \nBut it was so fun to plan!  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NY4-L7ZpADA/UViWFN7AdCI/AAAAAAAABnM/WcESzr-QwJI/s640/IMG_4357.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NY4-L7ZpADA/UViWFN7AdCI/AAAAAAAABnM/WcESzr-QwJI/s1600/IMG_4357.jpg)  \n    \n_Balloons are the happiest things on earth. _  \nAnyway, when I got home after getting all sunburned at Rock Canyon, I was really craving more lemon. I had a bunch of cream cheese to use, so...  \n### Lemon Cheesecake   \n1 9-inch cheesecake  \n    \n1 1/2 cups gingersnaps, smashed to smithereens  \n3 tbsp sugar  \n5 tbsp butter, melted  \n    \n4-5 8 oz packages of cream cheese, room temperature  \n1 cup sugar  \n3 eggs  \n1 cup sour cream  \n1/2 tsp vanilla  \n3 tbsp fresh lemon juice  \nzest of 1 lemon  \n    \n1\\. Mix the crushed gingersnaps, sugar, and butter together until all the gingersnaps are moistened (I used my pastry cutter). Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and bake at 325 for 10 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. Beat the cream cheese and sugar together for about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat between each. Add the sour cream and beat. Add the vanilla, lemon juice, and zest. Beat.   \n    \n3\\. Pour it into the crust and bake for approximately 1 hour at 325 degrees fahrenheit. Bake with a pan of water on a rack below the cheesecake.   \n    \n4\\. When it's done, it will be jiggly all over and more jiggly in the middle. Don't remove it from the oven-- crack the oven and turn it off. Keep it open for about 10 minutes, then close for about 30. Do this twice.   \n    \n5\\. Refrigerate for about 4 hours.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s_qqUdVqrZ4/UVeR3MOL-xI/AAAAAAAABmg/Ntv5h4_1gW0/s640/P1019616.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s_qqUdVqrZ4/UVeR3MOL-xI/AAAAAAAABmg/Ntv5h4_1gW0/s1600/P1019616.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bfVRPDOH6CU/UVeTA-azOLI/AAAAAAAABmw/gRCzkaIdyFM/s640/P1019620.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bfVRPDOH6CU/UVeTA-azOLI/AAAAAAAABmw/gRCzkaIdyFM/s1600/P1019620.JPG)  \n    \n_Doesn't it look so pretty?_  \n    \nWhite Chocolate Ganache  \n    \n1 cup white chocolate   \n1/2 cup heavy cream  \n    \nMicrowave heavy cream until it's really hot and pour it on top of the white chocolate. Whisk it until all the chocolate is melted. Pour it on top of the lemon cheesecake.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZdLgUv1s-s/UVeTZc3rBjI/AAAAAAAABm4/BUh6nP3uy90/s640/P1019631.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZdLgUv1s-s/UVeTZc3rBjI/AAAAAAAABm4/BUh6nP3uy90/s1600/P1019631.JPG)  \n    \n_Top with whipped cream and lemon wedges!_  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lzwdiKNRC6o/UViW-RoNQoI/AAAAAAAABng/PV2Jlc5DirY/s640/P1019639.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lzwdiKNRC6o/UViW-RoNQoI/AAAAAAAABng/PV2Jlc5DirY/s1600/P1019639.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JKDtE_ePhMo/UViYVkfL5aI/AAAAAAAABnk/HXVd3tP0aQ4/s640/P1019642.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JKDtE_ePhMo/UViYVkfL5aI/AAAAAAAABnk/HXVd3tP0aQ4/s1600/P1019642.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lm9wI4c8Stw/UViZWdXAfYI/AAAAAAAABoA/LZ7GjPFFtbU/s640/P1019669.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lm9wI4c8Stw/UViZWdXAfYI/AAAAAAAABoA/LZ7GjPFFtbU/s1600/P1019669.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nXOupfJg2Ss/UViYqm2HXsI/AAAAAAAABns/Jh-HO_z0ZhA/s640/P1019649.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nXOupfJg2Ss/UViYqm2HXsI/AAAAAAAABns/Jh-HO_z0ZhA/s1600/P1019649.JPG)"

Spring has arrived! After months and months of freezing snowy weather, it got warm! Happy day!  \n    \nLemon is obviously the best way invite spring back.   \n    \nI had been craving blueberries and lemon, so I decided to make a moist lemon-blueberry pound cake.   \n    \nWhat I thought of when I made this was the time I discovered lemon zest. I was using recipe that called for lemon zest. I asked my dad what that meant and he said, \"It's the outside of the lemon grated.\"   \nI didn't understand. Why would anyone want to eat the peel? Isn't that like eating a banana peel?  \n    \nI was _disgusted_.  \n    \nBUT... I have learned to really love lemon zest. It adds texture and taste to lemony recipes that can't be created any other way! So, I encourage you to leave the lemon zest in this recipe! Don't skip out on it!  \n    \n### Lemon-Blueberry Pound Cake  \nYields: 1 loaf  \n  \n1 1/3 cup flour  \n1/4 tsp baking soda  \npinch of salt  \n1 stick of butter, softened  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n1 tbsp lemon zest  \n2 eggs  \n1/2 sour cream  \n2 tbsp milk  \n3 tbsp lemon juice  \n1/2 cup blueberries  \n  \n1 cup powdered sugar  \n3 tbsp lemon juice  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease and lightly flour a 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan.  \n  \n2\\. Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. In a separate medium bowl, cream butter, sugar, and lemon zest for about 4 minutes on a high speed until it's light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for about 30 seconds after each egg.  \n  \n3\\. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and milk. To the butter mixture, add the flour and the sour cream mixtures, alternating between the two while mixing. Add the lemon juice and beat for 1 minute so it's well incorporated.  \n  \n4\\. Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes for an 8x4 or 45-50 minutes for a 9x5.  \n  \n5\\. Whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice and glaze over the pound cake when it's still warm.  \n  \n6\\. Enjoy!  \n  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ErEtixoleQY/UVSYzqUwnOI/AAAAAAAABkI/Bw5_wn9dEXU/s640/P1019587.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ErEtixoleQY/UVSYzqUwnOI/AAAAAAAABkI/Bw5_wn9dEXU/s1600/P1019587.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A-geGxd6_bQ/UVSZHVfIhkI/AAAAAAAABkQ/BK92mKroU4Q/s640/P1019596.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A-geGxd6_bQ/UVSZHVfIhkI/AAAAAAAABkQ/BK92mKroU4Q/s1600/P1019596.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PqyRw7LP2xM/UVTfZ1DGU-I/AAAAAAAABlQ/-Xq1QzJYRvI/s640/P1019599.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PqyRw7LP2xM/UVTfZ1DGU-I/AAAAAAAABlQ/-Xq1QzJYRvI/s1600/P1019599.JPG)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9bxCzHwW0Hs/UVTfZwBiUMI/AAAAAAAABlA/lTk_EyMutI4/s640/P1019612.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9bxCzHwW0Hs/UVTfZwBiUMI/AAAAAAAABlA/lTk_EyMutI4/s1600/P1019612.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ycul4iwzK5U/UVTfZ3FREEI/AAAAAAAABlI/-6H_AW6up4s/s640/P1019609.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ycul4iwzK5U/UVTfZ3FREEI/AAAAAAAABlI/-6H_AW6up4s/s1600/P1019609.JPG)    \n    \n_Bon appétit! _"

Story of my stinking life. I crave things all the time that I've never had. I set out to find a delicious recipe for a moist banana bundt. At first I was searching for something with sour cream to make sure it was moist, but I decided to go with a recipe I found on Pinterest. I'm so glad I did! It was so unbelievably moist.   \n    \nToday was definitely a baking day. I woke up to a fresh blanket of snow covering the ground. It's LATE MARCH! Utah is _crazy_!  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n-WjfQR40o8/UU5CohbdCqI/AAAAAAAABg0/yCvHWuya-to/s640/P1019317.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n-WjfQR40o8/UU5CohbdCqI/AAAAAAAABg0/yCvHWuya-to/s1600/P1019317.JPG)  \n    \nTweaked from [Hungry Couple NYC](http://hungrycouplenyc.blogspot.com/2013/03/bananas-foster-bundt-cake-bundtamonth.html).  \n### Banana Bundt  \n4 tbsp melted butter  \n1 tbsp flour  \n3/4 cup light brown sugar  \n1 banana, peeled and sliced  \n  \n2 cups all purpose flour  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n1 tsp baking soda  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1 (8 tbsp) stick butter, softened  \n3/4 cup light brown sugar  \n3 tsp vanilla  \n2 eggs  \n1 cup buttermilk (1 cup milk + 1 tsp vinegar)  \n2 bananas, mashed  \n  \n1\\.

Add the mashed bananas and mix. Slowly add the dry ingredients until it's fully incorporated.  \n  \n3\\. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

I HAD to try it. I honestly didn't have a choice. As soon as I saw it, I had no control over what I did from there on out. PINTEREST WAS POSSESSING ME.   \n    \nIt's cinnamon roll pull apart bread so it's basically the _best thing ever_. I tweaked it from [My Chocolate Therapy](http://www.mychocolatetherapy.com/2012/01/cinnamon-roll-pull-apart-bread.html).   \n    \n### Cinnamon Roll Pull Apart Bread  \nYields: 1 9x5 loaf (12 servings or 1 serving if you're me-- anything is a single serving if you put your mind to it)  \n    \n**Dough**  \n2 3/4 cups all purpose flour  \n2 tbsp cornstarch  \n3/4 tsp salt  \n2 1/4 tsp dried active yeast  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1/3 cup milk  \n1/4 cup butter  \n1/4 cup water  \n2 eggs  \n1 tsp vanilla extract  \n  \n**Filling**  \n2/3 cup dark brown sugar  \n2 tbsp ground cinnamon  \n1 tsp cornstarch  \n  \n1/4 cup butter, softened  \n  \n**Glaze**  \n3/4 cup powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp vanilla extract  \ncream or milk  \n    \n1\\. So I used my bread machine for this. I put all the dough ingredients in my bread maker starting with all the wet ingredients (I heated the milk and water so they were slightly warm). I then added all the dry ingredients, ending with the yeast on top. I put my bread machine on the dough cycle and went to class. When I came back, it was gloriously puffy and beautiful! I'm in love with my bread machine (Thanks, Aunt Tam!)  \n    \nIf you don't have a bread machine, just do it like the original recipe [tells you to](http://www.mychocolatetherapy.com/2012/01/cinnamon-roll-pull-apart-bread.html).   \n    \n2\\. Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured surface into about 18x18 inches. Spread about 2/3 of the softened butter on it and then mix together the filling. Spread the filling on top of the butter.   \n    \n3\\. Roll up and use dental floss to cut the dough into 1 cm thin cinnamon rolls. Brush a little of the leftover butter on top of each one and cover with plastic wrap. Roll them out until they're about 1/2 their original thickness. Stack them in about stacks of 5.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-osgGauxGyQo/UUtXo8owxzI/AAAAAAAABck/l5CjAEZS1e0/s640/P1019266.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-osgGauxGyQo/UUtXo8owxzI/AAAAAAAABck/l5CjAEZS1e0/s1600/P1019266.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kx1iW02qNrI/UUtXonBkUGI/AAAAAAAABcg/WNks7e26228/s640/P1019273.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kx1iW02qNrI/UUtXonBkUGI/AAAAAAAABcg/WNks7e26228/s1600/P1019273.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wfg-InHLe9A/UUtXp08_z-I/AAAAAAAABc4/L4SYc2b92Qw/s640/P1019276.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wfg-InHLe9A/UUtXp08_z-I/AAAAAAAABc4/L4SYc2b92Qw/s1600/P1019276.JPG)  \n    \n    \n4\\.

Not just the flavor, either. I've been into the color mint, and I've recently purchased some mint pants which I'm kind of obsessed with wearing. It's such a happy color!  \n  \nWith St. Patty's day coming up tomorrow, I decided to make something with a little minty green. I wanted it to use Andes Mints because those things are obviously the best thing that has ever happened to after-dinner mints.  \n  \nAndes Mints are the perfect marriage of silky smooth chocolate and cool mint.  \n  \nI'm obsessed.  \n  \nI had been craving them lately so I decided to make some Andes Mint cupcakes. I wanted a really light and fluffy chocolate cupcake, a minty chocolate mousse filling, and cool buttercream on top. I found the fluffiest chocolate cupcake recipe _ever_ at [My Baking Addiction](http://www.mybakingaddiction.com/chocolate-chocolate-cupcakes-recipe/) (tweaked to my taste).  \n    \n### Perfect Chocolate Cupcakes  \nYields: 18 cupcakes (I made 12 regular + 18 minis)  \n  \n1 cup flour (I used 1 1/4 cups because I'm at high altitude)  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1 tsp baking soda  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder  \n1/2 cup oil (I used veggie oil)  \n1 cup hot water  \n1 egg  \n1 1/2 tsp vanilla  \n  \n1\\. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and the wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet while mixing. That's it! You could even probably do it all in one bowl at once (that's what the original recipe did). I mixed it by hand and it was super easy!  \n  \n2\\. Fill baking cups 2/3 of the way for sea level or 1/2 way for high altitude. Bake at 350 for about 12-15 minutes for full-sized or 9-11 for mini cupcakes.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-77KPetnKDo0/UUTYazm-cBI/AAAAAAAABbM/s6LbT9xzF3I/s640/P1019204.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-77KPetnKDo0/UUTYazm-cBI/AAAAAAAABbM/s6LbT9xzF3I/s1600/P1019204.JPG)  \n    \n### Andes Mint Mousse Filling  \n2/3 cup whipping cream  \n1/3 cup Andes mints, melted (I used the Andes Creme de Menthe baking chips they came out with-- they're pre-broken up for you)  \n  \nWhip up the cream until it holds stiff peaks. Add the melted chocolate mints and whip until it's just incorporated.  \n  \nCut the center of the cupcakes out with a knife or a handy-dandy cupcake cutter. I found this at Walmart (2 for $1!) and had to see if it worked. Much to my surprise, it worked like a charm! You just stick it in, twist, and pull up! Voilà! C'est magnifique!  \n  \nFill each cupcake and put the top back on, if desired. I always do just because I like how it looks better.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C8cp1sl2Y7E/UUTYapAMELI/AAAAAAAABbI/38EJt1L3TkU/s640/P1019205.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C8cp1sl2Y7E/UUTYapAMELI/AAAAAAAABbI/38EJt1L3TkU/s1600/P1019205.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-04eKnOeW1-4/UUTYUYzRSYI/AAAAAAAABa4/7hndS3CMcdM/s640/magic+cupcake+thing.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-04eKnOeW1-4/UUTYUYzRSYI/AAAAAAAABa4/7hndS3CMcdM/s1600/magic+cupcake+thing.JPG)  \n    \n### Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting  \n4 oz cream cheese  \n1 stick (8 tbsp) butter  \n3-4 cups powdered sugar  \n2 tsp vanilla  \nabout 15 drops of green food coloring  \n  \nBeat the cream cheese and butter together. Add the food coloring and beat. Add the vanilla and then the powdered sugar, slowly. Beat it until it's stiff and lovely! Frost cupcakes with a star tip. Top with Andes Mints or drizzle a little bit of melted Andes Mints in a decorative pattern. Enjoy!  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1I8pQIGUm0Q/UUTYa5svEpI/AAAAAAAABbQ/j4_Z-CpHrRI/s640/P1019212.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1I8pQIGUm0Q/UUTYa5svEpI/AAAAAAAABbQ/j4_Z-CpHrRI/s1600/P1019212.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ux6x-Ca75OY/UUTYb8AgzNI/AAAAAAAABbo/WauBbjnSIWY/s640/P1019236.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ux6x-Ca75OY/UUTYb8AgzNI/AAAAAAAABbo/WauBbjnSIWY/s1600/P1019236.JPG)  \n    \nI drizzled the minis because I had some leftover melted mints.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6xLqbbMmGhY/UUTYdFWxFTI/AAAAAAAABb4/ebAWcxUUNLE/s640/P1019247.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6xLqbbMmGhY/UUTYdFWxFTI/AAAAAAAABb4/ebAWcxUUNLE/s1600/P1019247.JPG)  \n    \nI enjoyed mine with Martinelli's, because what isn't improved by sparkling cider?  \n    \n    \nHappy St. Patty's everyone!"

First of all, it's my best friend Kaki's birthday. We've been best friends since kindergarten and I'm so blessed to have her in my life!  \n  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pUwhi1N3DYw/UUI12LgHSmI/AAAAAAAABaQ/HIQxuk9nxjU/s640/Kaki+Card.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pUwhi1N3DYw/UUI12LgHSmI/AAAAAAAABaQ/HIQxuk9nxjU/s1600/Kaki+Card.jpg)  \n    \nSecond of all, pie is the superior dessert. If you don't believe me, [_click here_](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/03/pie-verus-cake-scientific-approach.html).   \n    \nApple pie and [_pumpkin pie_](/2012/11/the-perfect-pumpkin-pie-and-flakiest.html) are my favorite types of pies.  \n    \nToday I decided on apple pie because it's March and however much I may want pumpkin pie all year round, I think it makes it better to have it only in the fall. It makes it more special, you know?  \n    \nSo I went with _apple!_  \n    \nThis recipe is just a family recipe my mom passed on to me. We change the ratio or apples & sugar every time, but this is what I went with this time.   \n    \nI used my absolute favorite pie crust recipe, brought to us by America's favorite baker, Martha Stewart. The trick is the ice-cold water. It's totally worth making, y'all! Don't buy an icky pre-made pie crust.   \n    \n    \n### Perfect Flaky Pie Crust  \nYield: 1 single crust 9-inch pie (I doubled this because my pie had two crusts)  \n    \n1 1/2 cups flour  \n1 tbsp sugar  \n1 tsp salt  \n9 tbsp butter (1 stick plus 1 tbsp), chilled and cut into 1 tbsp cubes  \n1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp ice-cold water  \n    \n1\\. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.   \n    \n2\\. Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles crumbs.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zjMYsMKGzaw/UKag0aBf4ZI/AAAAAAAABIM/ZrVWudyHW_o/s1600/220px-Kitchen-Dough-Blender.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zjMYsMKGzaw/UKag0aBf4ZI/AAAAAAAABIM/ZrVWudyHW_o/s1600/220px-Kitchen-Dough-Blender.jpg)  \n_This is a pastry cutter. _  \n    \n    \n3\\. Slowly add the water while cutting until it's incorporated and flaky but sticks together.   \n    \n4\\. Form into a ball with your hands and flatten slightly so it's a disk shape. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour, up to 1 day. You can freeze it for up to a month, as long as you thaw it for 24 hours in the fridge before using.   \n    \n5\\. Roll it out and transfer to a pie pan. Cut the extra on the edges of the pie pan. \"Fork\" the crust. Preheat oven to 425 F. Refrigerate pie crust for 15 minutes while the oven is heating.   \n    \n6\\. If desired, place foil in the bottom of the pie crust and add dried beans as pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes, making sure to puncture the crust with a fork if it gets puffy while it's baking.   \n    \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rNa9WrD3SVg/UUI1Y8Ro4gI/AAAAAAAABaI/CpYc8TEzzII/s640/FotoFlexer_Photo.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rNa9WrD3SVg/UUI1Y8Ro4gI/AAAAAAAABaI/CpYc8TEzzII/s1600/FotoFlexer_Photo.jpg)  \n    \nThese are old pictures from when I made another pie.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WMMWoc0SBfM/UUI0yzBspdI/AAAAAAAABZY/XM4ccv6GILU/s640/P1019117.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WMMWoc0SBfM/UUI0yzBspdI/AAAAAAAABZY/XM4ccv6GILU/s1600/P1019117.JPG)  \n    \n    \n### Apple Pie  \nYields: 1 9 inch pie   \n    \n2 recipes flakiest pie crust (bottom crust pre-baked)  \n8 cups apples-- I love using honeycrisp, but they're out of season right now so I used 10 granny smiths  \n1/2 cup to 2/3 cup white sugar, depending on the sweetness of the apples  \n1/3 cup brown sugar  \n3/4 tsp cinnamon  \n1/2 tsp nutmeg  \n4 tbsp flour  \n1 tbsp lemon juice  \n1 egg  \n1 tbsp half and half or cream  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aXoSkEOeMlI/UUI0yuScQaI/AAAAAAAABZU/AYdFZhFC5tA/s640/P1019120.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aXoSkEOeMlI/UUI0yuScQaI/AAAAAAAABZU/AYdFZhFC5tA/s1600/P1019120.JPG)  \n    \n1\\. Peel, core, and slice apples into small (1/4 inch) slices. Put them into a large pot.

Cook at low-medium heat for about 8-10 minutes, or until the apples are slightly softened.   \n    \n3\\. Pour all the warm apples into the pre-baked bottom pie crust. Roll out the top pie crust and make whatever pattern on the pie crust you like. Brush the top with an egg wash of egg and half and half.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nNMn0UMUniY/UUI0z7vsMUI/AAAAAAAABZk/G7U6qMni7-M/s640/P1019134.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nNMn0UMUniY/UUI0z7vsMUI/AAAAAAAABZk/G7U6qMni7-M/s1600/P1019134.JPG)  \n    \n4\\.

You could really do this with any fruit. Look how cute they are! I filled them with the apples I cooked for the apple pie, brushed them with a little egg wash, and baked them on my silpat for 20 minutes.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aomulJVZOfU/UUJe3Lg2UXI/AAAAAAAABac/f1wn1T0jkhk/s640/WM+mini+pie.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aomulJVZOfU/UUJe3Lg2UXI/AAAAAAAABac/f1wn1T0jkhk/s1600/WM+mini+pie.JPG)  \n    \n_Make anything bite-size and you can expect lots of \"AWWW!!!\"s_  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9TijfhcuUAI/UUI00HgwtxI/AAAAAAAABZo/duHXaq0tyM4/s640/P1019147.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9TijfhcuUAI/UUI00HgwtxI/AAAAAAAABZo/duHXaq0tyM4/s1600/P1019147.jpg)  \n    \nHow did you celebrate Pi Day?  \n    \n    \nGo out and have some irrational fun!   \n    \n    \n    \n(_I know, I know.

I didn't know you could lose sleep over cravings!  \nI went to four stores looking for raspberries, and the only one that had them was the BYU creamery, which had a teeeeeny tiny container for $6.89.  \n  \nI thought it was a joke. Seven bucks for raspberries?  \n  \nThankfully, my roommate Lexie is a sweetheart and used her meal plan to pay for them because I was bound and determined to not pay that much for raspberries. (She's the _best_.)  \n  \nSo I had dreamed up (literally had a dream about them) a recipe for Raspberry White Chocolate Truffle cupcakes. I looked everywhere and they _just didn't exist_.  \n  \nSo I went on an adventure to invent them.  \n  \nAnd man, are these _winners_!!! They are just as good as they sound.  \n  \nI wanted the base of the cupcake to be a really, really fluffy vanilla. I wanted them to be filled with white chocolate mousse. I wanted the frosting to be really fluffy raspberry buttercream with a hint of white chocolate. And I wanted them to be adorable.  \n  \nI tweaked my white cupcake recipe from [Couple Of Cooks](http://www.couple-of-cooks.com/very-vanilla-cupcakes/).  \n    \n### White Cupcakes  \nYields 18-20 deliciously full-sized cupcakes    \n*   1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n*   1 cup cake flour (I used 1 cup minus 2 tbsp all purpose flour, then added 2 tbsp corn starch. This is my go-to cake flour recipe. Make sure to mix the flour and corn starch together really well.)\n*   1 teaspoon baking powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n*   1/2 teaspoon salt\n*   1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n*   1 cup sugar\n*   1 cup sour cream\n*   1/2 cup milk\n*   4 large egg whites, room temperature (I put my cold eggs soaking in warm water for 3 minutes or so)\n*   3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 375 fahrenheit (If you're at high altitude, preheat to 385). Line cupcake tins with adorable cupcake liners.  \n  \n2\\. Mix together flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk until incorporated.  \n  \n3\\. In a medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, milk, and egg whites. **Set aside. **  \n4\\. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.  \n  \n5\\. Add the vanilla extract to the butter mixture. While the mixer is on low, add the flour mixture in 3 parts alternating with the milk/sour cream mixture. (You'll start and end with flour mixture).  \n  \n6\\. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. (If you make mini cupcakes, they take about 13 minutes.)  \n  \n    \n### White Chocolate Filling  \n1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream  \n1/2 cup white chocolate chips (I used Guittard's white chocolate chips-- they're _so_ delicious!)  \n    \nWhip the cream until it holds stiff peaks. Melt the white chocolate really slowly (15 seconds at a time, stirring between each time). Add the melted chocolate to the whipped cream and whip it until it's really stiff and incorporated. Set aside about 1 cup for the frosting recipe.   \n    \n### Filling the Cupcakes  \n    \n    \nCut a cone shape out of the top of each cupcake. Cut the bottom tip of the cone shape off and discard (AKA eat that sucker before someone else does). Pipe some of the filling into the hole and put the flat top back on.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_1_v70Vf57A/UTuvAi4UlTI/AAAAAAAABYI/M7uxwhFOLYQ/s640/CUpcake.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_1_v70Vf57A/UTuvAi4UlTI/AAAAAAAABYI/M7uxwhFOLYQ/s1600/CUpcake.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab_xUwn-t9E/UTu0veaBGTI/AAAAAAAABYQ/kuxx6WAI8XE/s640/P1019039.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab_xUwn-t9E/UTu0veaBGTI/AAAAAAAABYQ/kuxx6WAI8XE/s1600/P1019039.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cWI4vX8-uEo/UTu0zMpRzpI/AAAAAAAABYY/QVrtM-f4EG8/s640/P1019040.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cWI4vX8-uEo/UTu0zMpRzpI/AAAAAAAABYY/QVrtM-f4EG8/s1600/P1019040.JPG)  \n    \n### White Chocolate Raspberry Frosting  \n1 cup of the white chocolate mousse filling  \n1 stick butter   \n2 cups powdered sugar  \n1/4 cup frozen raspberries, microwaved for about 20 seconds (I had fresh but I used frozen because when you thaw them in the microwave, they release so many juices. If you use fresh, microwave them to release the juices, enhance the flavor, and enhance the color.)  \n    \nCream the butter and add the powdered sugar. Add the raspberries slowly and then lastly add the mousse filling. Beat until it's really fluffy and tasty.   \n    \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VqnYJxeVdqQ/UTurFsS3cGI/AAAAAAAABXM/CW-4OHKKyyE/s640/P1019021.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VqnYJxeVdqQ/UTurFsS3cGI/AAAAAAAABXM/CW-4OHKKyyE/s1600/P1019021.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--dgCE95dEoI/UTuszVglWEI/AAAAAAAABXs/IH2SyAf8js8/s640/P1019046.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--dgCE95dEoI/UTuszVglWEI/AAAAAAAABXs/IH2SyAf8js8/s1600/P1019046.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7kYoXXIEv3c/UTuszAm-zJI/AAAAAAAABXg/uqy5UpjEh70/s640/P1019053.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7kYoXXIEv3c/UTuszAm-zJI/AAAAAAAABXg/uqy5UpjEh70/s1600/P1019053.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-17z1L70wQBI/UTu26PonBNI/AAAAAAAABYc/jW_MSnECsUk/s640/P1019054.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-17z1L70wQBI/UTu26PonBNI/AAAAAAAABYc/jW_MSnECsUk/s1600/P1019054.JPG)  \n    \n_Sweet action shot of me sprinkling it with white chocolate shavings_  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFAQKo_2bTI/UTu3PgAkynI/AAAAAAAABYk/qv2gaOk9ZvI/s640/P1019074.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HFAQKo_2bTI/UTu3PgAkynI/AAAAAAAABYk/qv2gaOk9ZvI/s1600/P1019074.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EM6SiecCLZg/UTus0JhiruI/AAAAAAAABYA/urYpMXxjPFg/s640/P1019095.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EM6SiecCLZg/UTus0JhiruI/AAAAAAAABYA/urYpMXxjPFg/s1600/P1019095.JPG)  \n    \nLook at that delicious white chocolate truffle filling!!  \n    \nDon't mind me...

Y'all, seriously. This cake is the moistest, most deliciously chocolate cake. It is AWESOME!  \n  \nMy \"family\" group at BYU has dinner pretty much every Sunday night. It's always so fun to cook together and spend time with our group.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-alkTKeymlKY/USqPIAHZVFI/AAAAAAAABSw/U0RDXVY18YQ/s640/734740_4751261533651_210470067_n.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-alkTKeymlKY/USqPIAHZVFI/AAAAAAAABSw/U0RDXVY18YQ/s1600/734740_4751261533651_210470067_n.jpg)  \n    \nLook how beautifully awkward we look!  \n    \nSo anyway, I made this delicious cake and I am so excited to share this recipe with you!  \n    \n### Moist Chocolate Bundt Cake  \n_Yield: 15 servings_  \n_Recipe adapted from [Neighbor Food Blog](http://www.neighborfoodblog.com/2012/02/best-chocolate-bundt-cake-of-your-life.html)._  \n**Ingredients:**  \n1 1/4 cups water  \n3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder  \n2 1/4 cups sugar  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  \n2 large eggs  \n1 egg yolk  \n1 1/4 cups milk  \n1 tbsp white vinegar  \n1 cup plus 2 tbsp vegetable oil  \n2 teaspoon vanilla extract  \n2 1/2 cups flour  \n    \n**For the glaze:**  \n3/4 cup chocolate chips  \n3/4 cup unsalted butter  \n3 cups powdered sugar  \n1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature  \n1/4 cup water  \n1/4 cup half and half or cream  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Generously butter and flour a bundt pan, making sure to coat every crevice. Tap the excess flour out and discard.   \n2\\. Whisk the water and cocoa powder in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring it to a boil and let it boil for about 30 seconds. Stir continually. Remove from heat and let it cool for about five minutes.  \n3\\. Measure out the milk and add in the vinegar. Let it sit for five minutes.  \n4\\. Beat sugar, salt, baking soda, eggs, and egg yolk until really well-incorporated. Add the milk mixture, along with oil and vanilla and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the flour and mix until it's thoroughly incorporated. Next, add the cocoa powder/water mixture and beat until there are no more lumps (about 2 minutes).   \n5\\. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.   \n6\\. Let the cake cool completely before adding the frosting.  \n### Frosting  \nMelt the chocolate chips. Melt the butter separately and then beat the butter with the melted chocolate. Add half the powdered sugar and whisk until smooth. Add the sour cream and the other half of the powdered sugar and beat. Add the sour cream and the water and beat until it's smooth. Pour over cooled cake and enjoy!  \n    \nI didn't wait for mine to cool, so my frosting was all melty, but that didn't stop anyone from eating it.   \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U7VgXKJ6ups/USqPPGMxQGI/AAAAAAAABS8/Fi4l75K7XFg/s640/IMG_4034.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U7VgXKJ6ups/USqPPGMxQGI/AAAAAAAABS8/Fi4l75K7XFg/s1600/IMG_4034.JPG)  \n    \nThe way I frosted it caused the center hole to be filled to the top with frosting, so when I cut into it, it made a huge mess... but we cleaned that up really fast with spoons.   \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mIW2e7iKvlI/USqeW6oudEI/AAAAAAAABUg/Kl4n7crF99A/s640/IMG_4036.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mIW2e7iKvlI/USqeW6oudEI/AAAAAAAABUg/Kl4n7crF99A/s1600/IMG_4036.JPG)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qa_3QQQt-no/USqeXaRwhvI/AAAAAAAABUk/uoP1lGL2EUA/s640/IMG_4037.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qa_3QQQt-no/USqeXaRwhvI/AAAAAAAABUk/uoP1lGL2EUA/s1600/IMG_4037.jpg)  \n    \nEnjoy!"

I mean, I might crave it on a very, very rare occasion.   \n    \nThe only type of chocolate cake I really, truly _love_ is red velvet. And we all know that cupcakes are always better than regular cake.   \n    \nYesterday I got home from class and didn't feel like getting to my homework immediately (still haven't gotten to that feeling yet, ever). I decided to make red velvet cupcakes instead.   \n    \nAfter searching for about ten minutes for the perfect recipe, I found this recipe. I tweaked it a little (what's new?)  \n    \nY'all. They were PERFECT. The consistency of the cupcake was so smooth and soft, and I used my personal favorite cream cheese frosting to top them off. This is now my go-to recipe for red velvet.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n7MLzVC9_0g/UQQu20eQdoI/AAAAAAAABRY/CMt-PkBOvq8/s640/P1018896.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n7MLzVC9_0g/UQQu20eQdoI/AAAAAAAABRY/CMt-PkBOvq8/s1600/P1018896.JPG)  \n    \n    \nAdapted from [The Boastful Baker](http://www.boastfulbaker.com/2012/07/14/remedy-for-a-dearth-of-cake/).   \n    \n### Mini Red Velvet Cupcakes  \nYields: 36 adorably mini cupcakes  \n    \nIngredients:  \n    \n1/2 cup buttermilk (1/2 cup milk plus 1 tsp white vinegar)  \n3/4 cup vegetable oil  \n1 egg  \n1 tsp red food coloring  \n2 tsp vanilla extract  \n1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  \n3/4 cup granulated sugar  \n1/2 tsp baking soda  \n1 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder  \n    \nBest Ever Cream Cheese Frosting  \n    \n1 (8 oz) block cream cheese, slightly softened  \n5 tbsp butter (slightly softened-- pliable but not room temperature)  \n2 tsp vanilla extract  \n2 cups powdered sugar  \n    \n1\\.

(You can also test with a toothpick but I always just touch the top. If your finger leaves a dent, they're not ready.)  \n    \n6\\. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, combine the cream cheese and butter. Whip until it's light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix. Really slowly, add the powdered sugar while the mixer is going. Mix it until it's really smooth and fluffy.   \n    \n7\\. Tape the corner of a quart-sized bag (for reinforcement), then cut the corner off about 1/2 inch from the very tip. Insert a decorator's star tip. Add the frosting to the bag and decorate the cupcakes once they've cooled. Add sprinkles (because sprinkles make everything happier).   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LBWIo6ODIEQ/UQQu2KP-_3I/AAAAAAAABRM/CxRmGR16zK4/s640/P1018873.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LBWIo6ODIEQ/UQQu2KP-_3I/AAAAAAAABRM/CxRmGR16zK4/s1600/P1018873.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gveHku2vgrY/UQQu17jfsQI/AAAAAAAABRQ/O5bWd3cp0aA/s640/P1018871.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gveHku2vgrY/UQQu17jfsQI/AAAAAAAABRQ/O5bWd3cp0aA/s1600/P1018871.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N788aslFTSc/UQQu27lUqAI/AAAAAAAABRc/bghEn40-D9I/s640/P1018891.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N788aslFTSc/UQQu27lUqAI/AAAAAAAABRc/bghEn40-D9I/s1600/P1018891.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w-T4pfAYX6U/UQQu3BCwGOI/AAAAAAAABRg/63GSYHlytfQ/s640/P1018899.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w-T4pfAYX6U/UQQu3BCwGOI/AAAAAAAABRg/63GSYHlytfQ/s1600/P1018899.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-URNucFzP0rE/UQQu1Yh_fqI/AAAAAAAABRA/VlVZkFjrd2s/s640/P1018869.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-URNucFzP0rE/UQQu1Yh_fqI/AAAAAAAABRA/VlVZkFjrd2s/s1600/P1018869.JPG)  \n    \n_Haha!

When I saw that this season's bachelor, Sean, is from Arlington, Texas, I couldn't resist watching. That's about twenty minutes from my house!  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_gmPJP16Pn4/UP4VonomVOI/AAAAAAAABPQ/qCOJVsGlIcE/s640/sean.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_gmPJP16Pn4/UP4VonomVOI/AAAAAAAABPQ/qCOJVsGlIcE/s1600/sean.jpg)  \n    \n_That is one fine man. _  \n    \nSo my apartment floor was having a Bachelor party tonight because it was Monday night and we all share a guilty pleasure for watching The Bachelor.   \n    \nI figured I should bring something sweet for us to eat while we watch.   \n    \nI bought Oreos a few weeks ago, but instead of the normal Double Stuff ones, I bought chocolate-filled Oreos, which are not nearly as good as the Double Stuff ones. I decided to use them in a recipe since they weren't that great on their own.   \n    \nI found a recipe for [Oreo Cheesecake Bites](http://scrumptiousandsumptuous.wordpress.com/2012/03/10/oreo-cheesecake-bites-and-oreo-truffles/). I sort of used the recipe on the link provided, but I definitely made some modifications. They were AMAZING. They were even tasty enough to get me through all the stupidity [Tierra](http://bachelorsean.com/the-bachelor-2013-new-promo-pictures/tierra-licausi-after-fall-at-mansion/) put us through tonight.   \n    \n### Oreo Cheesecake Bites  \nYields: about 50 cheesecake bites (It makes one 9x13 pan, so you can cut them however small or large you want to. I wanted them to go a long way)  \n    \nIngredients:  \n    \n20 Oreos  \n4 tbsp butter, melted  \n    \n3 8 oz. packages of cream cheese, room temperature  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n3/4 cup sour cream  \n1 tsp vanilla  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk  \n16 Oreos  \n    \n1/4 cup white chocolate chips  \n1 tbsp vegetable oil  \n    \nDirections:  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.  \n    \n2\\. Line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper, leaving the parchment large enough to go up two of the sides  to allow for easier removal.  \n    \n3\\. Smash 20 Oreos to smithereens in a gallon ziplock. Add the melted butter and squish it all around. Make sure all of the Oreos have some of the butter on them so they stick together. Press the mixture into the pan. Bake for 10 minutes.  \n    \n4\\. Beat the cream cheese in a bowl until it's light and fluffy. Add the sugar and make sure it's completely incorporated. Add the sour cream, vanilla, and salt.   \n    \n5\\. Add the eggs and scrape down the bowl. Make sure everything is completely mixed with no chunks.   \n    \n6\\. Crush the remaining 16 Oreos (not completely smashed, just broken up into pieces). Gently stir them into the cream cheese mixture.  \n    \n7\\. Pour this onto the Oreo crust. Bake for 40 minutes, or until it's slightly jiggly in the center.   \n    \n8\\. Put it in the fridge for at least two hours. Run a knife around the edge and use the parchment paper to remove it from the pan. Cut into desired size (I did about 1.5x1.5). Make sure to wipe the knife on a paper towel between each cut.   \n    \n9\\. Melt the white chocolate and add a little bit of vegetable oil to smooth it out. Put it into a sandwich baggie and cut the very teeny tip off of the corner. Drizzle the chocolate on each square in a decorative pattern. Let the chocolate harden in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes. Enjoy!  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JMl7eU7cNjU/UP4WTxqDKII/AAAAAAAABP0/2m9SAB4WR_4/s640/P1018844.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JMl7eU7cNjU/UP4WTxqDKII/AAAAAAAABP0/2m9SAB4WR_4/s1600/P1018844.JPG)  \n    \n    \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DtysJgWJacg/UP4WTxHv3mI/AAAAAAAABP4/oNqm0iI-hLs/s640/P1018846.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DtysJgWJacg/UP4WTxHv3mI/AAAAAAAABP4/oNqm0iI-hLs/s1600/P1018846.JPG)  \n    \n    \n_I'm still rooting for Sarah.

French toast, bread pudding, and banana bread are the tastiest ways to reduce waste in the kitchen.  \n  \nSo we had these bananas that were... um, vintage. All I'm saying is that if these bananas were people, they would be living in a nursing home and asking for a sponge bath every night while talking of the \"good ol' days.\"  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Q-XjmoZiLI/UPsXa04wZnI/AAAAAAAABMQ/85_0UFyNbiQ/s640/IMG_3863.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Q-XjmoZiLI/UPsXa04wZnI/AAAAAAAABMQ/85_0UFyNbiQ/s1600/IMG_3863.JPG)  \n    \nThese are the most photogenic bananas, turned to their most beautiful angle. The others were completely black and were indiscernible as bananas. Welcome to college.  \n    \n    \nOne thing I would like to say is that brown butter is the _best thing ever_.   \n    \nMy whole apartment has a delicious nutty smell right now and I keep just pausing and taking a long moment to sniff the air... Yeah. Definitely addicted.   \n    \nI modified this recipe from [La Casa de Sweets](http://lacasadesweets.com/blog/2011/10/05/brown-butter-banana-bread/).   \n    \n### Brown Butter Banana Bread  \nYields: Two 9x5 loaves \\*\\*\\*This time I made two 8x4 loaves plus one mini loaf.\\*\\*\\*  \n  \nBanana bread:  \n  \n2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter  \n3 cups flour  \n1/2 tsp salt  \n2 tsp baking soda  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n2 eggs  \n1 1/2 cups sugar  \n5-6 of your most overly-ripe, disgusting bananas  \n4 tbsp milk  \n2 tsp vanilla extract  \n  \nPan lining:  \n  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n  \nCrumble topping:  \n  \n1/2 cup flour  \n4 tbsp sugar  \n4 tbsp light brown sugar  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n4 tbsp butter, very slightly softened and cut into cubes  \n  \n  \nDirections:  \n  \n1\\. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease the pans. Mix the pan lining sugar and cinnamon. Coat the inside of the pans with the cinnamon-sugar.  \n  \n2\\. Melt the butter on medium heat and let it bubble until it begins to turn brown. Mine always stops bubbling and just looks foamy when it's done. Just don't burn it! It should smell nutty and pleasant when it's barely done. Remove from heat.  \n  \n3\\. While the butter is browning, mix together the crumble topping. I always use [my beloved pastry cutter](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4430618975_eb8556c885.jpg), but you can use a fork to mix the crumble.  \n  \n4\\. Mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.  \n  \n5\\. Whisk together the eggs and sugar. Beat it with the whisk until it becomes a pale yellow, nearly white. Whisk in the brown butter.  \n  \n6\\. In a separate bowl, mash together your peeled bananas. Add them to the brown butter mixture. Add in the milk and vanilla.  \n  \n7\\. Evenly distribute the batter between the prepared pans and top with the crumble topping.  \n  \n8\\. Bake 9x5 loaves for 1 hour, 8x4 loaves for 50-55 minutes, and mini loaves for 35 minutes.  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nb0ZGzN0-hU/UPtePDkW5rI/AAAAAAAABOY/Sy1zNMrKqzY/s640/P1018838.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nb0ZGzN0-hU/UPtePDkW5rI/AAAAAAAABOY/Sy1zNMrKqzY/s1600/P1018838.JPG)  \n  \n    \n_It's super moist and delicious! I think the brown butter makes it, honestly. All banana bread is good, but brown butter banana bread is YUMMOLICIOUS. _  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LXKDIEk-50M/UPtbkD_UjWI/AAAAAAAABNI/Fa0SCnTDc9Y/s640/IMG_3827.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LXKDIEk-50M/UPtbkD_UjWI/AAAAAAAABNI/Fa0SCnTDc9Y/s1600/IMG_3827.jpg)"

You see, Lian knows me very well. She bought me only food-scented wax thingies to melt in my Scentsy.   \n    \nThe wax thingy I picked for this week to make my room smell like was the \"Cinnamon Bun\" wax, and for about a week I craved cinnamon rolls without understanding why. But worry not, for I have discovered the source of my craving and have been able to satisfy it with a recipe I found for Cinnabon Copycat Cinnamon Rolls!  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W7JVwVYv3Lg/UExKQubykmI/AAAAAAAABHY/tg1D6QpUtCI/s640/P1018648.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W7JVwVYv3Lg/UExKQubykmI/AAAAAAAABHY/tg1D6QpUtCI/s1600/P1018648.JPG)  \n    \n    \nCinnabon Copycat  \nVia: [The Girl Who Ate Everthing](http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2008/%E2%80%A6)  \n    \nYield: 12 cinnamon rolls  \n    \nDough:  \n1 cup warm milk (microwaved for about 60 seconds or until it's warmer than your finger)  \n2 eggs, room temperature  \n1/3 cup butter, melted, cooled down to room temperature  \n4 1/2 cups flour (I used all purpose although bread flour would be a good replacement)  \n1 tsp salt  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n1 package yeast (1/4 oz)  \n    \nFilling:  \n1 cup brown sugar  \n2 1/2 tbsp cinnamon  \n1/3 butter, softened  \n    \nFrosting:  \n4 oz. cream cheese, softened  \n4 tbsp butter, softened  \n1 1/2 cup powdered sugar  \n1/2 tsp vanilla extract  \n1/8 tsp salt  \n    \n1\\. Dissolve yeast in warm milk for about 10 minutes.   \n    \n2\\. Add eggs and butter. Combine flour, salt, and sugar, and add to the wet ingredients.   \n    \n3\\. Mix well and knead with your hands (or your stand mixer if you're not a poor college student) for about 1 minute. Spray a bowl with cooking spray and put the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place (I used my oven at 175) for 1 hour or until doubled in size.   \n    \n4\\. In a separate bowl, combine brown sugar with cinnamon.   \n    \n5\\. Once the dough has risen for 1 hour, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to 16\"x21\". Spread the softened butter across the dough and sprinkle the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top of the butter.   \n    \n6\\. Roll up the dough so that it's 21\" long. Cut it in half, then each of those in half (so you have four equal pieces). Cut each of those into three so you end up with twelve equal pieces. Hopefully that wasn't _too_ confusing.   \n    \n7\\. Butter up (or cooking spray if you're in a hurry) a 9x13 pan. Place the cinnamon rolls 4 by 3 in the pan. Let them rise another 30 minutes, or until doubled, covered in the warm place.   \n    \n\\*\\*\\*If you're making them the night before, now is when you put them into the fridge\\*\\*\\*  \n    \n8\\.

I put 1 tsp of olive oil with the dried rosemary before I added my other herbs and spices, just so they would stick to the rosemary. I also transferred my dough to a metal bowl sprayed with my handy dandy olive oil before letting it rise. The third thing I did differently was every ten minutes the dough was rising, I would take the rag off and microwave the rag for another 30 seconds to make sure the rag stayed damp and warm.  \n  \nOther than those minor improvements, I did it the same! Now I just need some Macaroni Grill pasta to go with it!  \n  \n  \nThe original recipe is [here](/2012/06/macaroni-grill-bread-and-gilmores.html).   \n  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d9Wb_-5b3Tw/UC7134M1ipI/AAAAAAAABFI/13hC3v1wJJg/s640/P1018475.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d9Wb_-5b3Tw/UC7134M1ipI/AAAAAAAABFI/13hC3v1wJJg/s1600/P1018475.JPG)  \n    \nMmmm... olive oil and balsamic vinegar go so well with this bread.   \n    \n    \nWhat restaurant foods do you want a recipe for?"

They make any normal cake, ice cream, or plain dessert instantly more delicious. Today when I remembered it was my friend Megan's birthday, I decided she deserved Oreo cupcakes, as _every_ girl does on her birthday.   \n    \nI used my go-to vanilla cupcake recipe, this time using cake flour to make them a little fluffier. When deciding on the frosting, I went with something akin to the taste of the Oreo innards. The whipped yummy insides of Oreos are what make them worth eating, much like how the frosting makes a cupcake worth eating.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dZz0K4IuHTs/UCl2TrDbOWI/AAAAAAAABEQ/UlmFYAs5uek/s640/P1018420.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dZz0K4IuHTs/UCl2TrDbOWI/AAAAAAAABEQ/UlmFYAs5uek/s1600/P1018420.JPG)  \n    \nOreo Cupcakes  \nYield: 12 regular cupcakes or 24 mini cupcakes  \n    \n1 1/4 cup cake flour (you can use AP flour)  \n1 1/2 tsp baking powder  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n3/4 cup sugar  \n6 tbsp butter, room temperature  \n1 large egg plus 1 egg white  \n1 tsp vanilla (I used clear)  \n1/2 cup half and half (I have used anything from skim milk to heavy whipping cream and it always works out fine)  \n    \n6-8 Oreos, smashed to smithereens  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RzXur2PiJ80/UCl2OOWntqI/AAAAAAAABDw/Q1W5Hx7ImfE/s640/P1018396.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RzXur2PiJ80/UCl2OOWntqI/AAAAAAAABDw/Q1W5Hx7ImfE/s1600/P1018396.JPG)  \n    \n    \n1\\.

Mix this in with the butter/sugar alternately with the half and half. Beat until no flour is visible, making sure to scrape the bowl often. **Don't overbeat!** Add the crushed Oreos and mix until just incorporated.   \n5\\. Scoop batter into the prepared cupcake liners. Spray a cookie scoop with cooking spray so the batter is easily removed. Divide batter evenly (Or, if you're me, you divide batter so they're all equal except one is giant and you claim that one as soon as they leave the oven).   \n    \n6\\.

They're all full of deliciousness and sugar, which are my two favorite things.  \n  \nMy personal favorite dessert is cheesecake, but yesterday happened to be the national s'mores day. I couldn't just pass up on the _best holiday ever_.  \n  \nI decided to compromise and create my own recipe for s'mores cheesecake, and let me tell you: **BEST IDEA EVER.** I deserve a Nobel prize. No jokes here.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6GXBH-Gry1Y/UCbUOPulHKI/AAAAAAAABC4/TLsAwUMmAMs/s640/P1018384.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6GXBH-Gry1Y/UCbUOPulHKI/AAAAAAAABC4/TLsAwUMmAMs/s1600/P1018384.JPG)  \n  \n  \nCheesecake already has a graham cracker crust, so I just needed to add the marshmallows and chocolate.  \n  \nAlso, my 6 inch springform has been feeling very lonely lately. I adapted a traditional New York Style cheesecake recipe to make it work for a 6 inch springform.  \n    \n### S'mores Cheesecake  \nYield: 6\" cheesecake  \n  \n3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs  \n4 tbsp butter (I used my [homemade butter](/2012/08/mason-jar-butter.html))  \n2 tbsp sugar  \n1 Hershey king-size chocolate bar  \n2 packages (16 oz) cream cheese, room temperature  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1 egg  \n1/2 tsp vanilla (clear if you can)  \n1 tbsp cornstarch  \n1/3 cup sour cream  \n2/3 cup chocolate chips  \n3 tbsp whipping cream  \n[Kraft Mallow Bits, for decoration](http://www.amazon.com/Kraft-Jet-puffed-Mallow-Vanilla-Marshmallows/dp/B007HS7CRW)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fjfaxOt4QoI/UCbT2ZIY7NI/AAAAAAAABA0/JcAlh9gdfRU/s640/P1018293.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fjfaxOt4QoI/UCbT2ZIY7NI/AAAAAAAABA0/JcAlh9gdfRU/s1600/P1018293.JPG)  \n  \n  \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  \n  \n2\\. Mix graham cracker crumbs with 2 tbsp sugar and butter. Use a fork to mix it together until it's crumbly. Press it along the bottom of the springform pan. Bake it for 8 minutes.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aaWQ-wzThhQ/UCbT4EINYbI/AAAAAAAABA8/zylE4xtot9E/s640/P1018301.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aaWQ-wzThhQ/UCbT4EINYbI/AAAAAAAABA8/zylE4xtot9E/s1600/P1018301.JPG)  \n    \n_Delicious homemade butter! _  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vMNKIVpeSpU/UCbT5mt376I/AAAAAAAABBE/yE8SIp1XSE0/s640/P1018303.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vMNKIVpeSpU/UCbT5mt376I/AAAAAAAABBE/yE8SIp1XSE0/s1600/P1018303.jpg)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6s_ZeSpBsDM/UCbT7HwX4mI/AAAAAAAABBM/oj-wEjTY6Qc/s640/P1018305.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6s_ZeSpBsDM/UCbT7HwX4mI/AAAAAAAABBM/oj-wEjTY6Qc/s1600/P1018305.JPG)  \n  \n3\\.

Pour the cream cheese mixture into the crust-lined pan. Tap the pan a few times to get rid of any bubbles (I do this with cake, too). Bake for 35-38 minutes.

After a week in San Francisco, it's nice to be home in good ol' Texas.   \n    \nOne thing I love about San Francisco is how every food place seems to try their hardest to find good quality, fresh ingredients. It seems everything is fresh, organic, and homemade.   \n    \nWhile we were at one of the restaurants, my mom told me about how she used to help her grandmother make butter out of whipping cream. She said her grandmother would hand her grandchildren the mason jars to keep them busy and productive... for about 20 minutes or so.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rp7wx9nVbqE/UCQ7IQtfC3I/AAAAAAAABAE/yVUVXoYNtNI/s400/41058_485202313851_3153607_n.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rp7wx9nVbqE/UCQ7IQtfC3I/AAAAAAAABAE/yVUVXoYNtNI/s1600/41058_485202313851_3153607_n.jpg)  \n    \n_This was back in the day- my mom's in the back right. _  \n    \n    \nI didn't believe my mom that butter was just made of cream. Surely there was something else!  \n    \nI was wrong. It really works! I did as my mother said (Surprise!) and filled a mason jar with cream. In 25 minutes I had butter! Weird!  \n    \nThe best part was I got a nice arm workout.   \n    \nMason Jar Butter  \n    \n1 mason jar  \n1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream (or however much fills your jar up 3/4 of the way)  \n1 tsp salt (optional- I didn't use this)  \n    \nYou can add cinnamon, sugar, honey, garlic powder, whatever you want, depending on what you're making it for! I personally just did the cream so I can add whatever I want serving by serving.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zO8dfWhLkwo/UCQ5u6q6tmI/AAAAAAAAA-o/wU6suqItJMc/s640/P1018195.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zO8dfWhLkwo/UCQ5u6q6tmI/AAAAAAAAA-o/wU6suqItJMc/s1600/P1018195.JPG)  \n    \n    \n1\\. Wash the mason jar to make sure it doesn't have anything dusty/weird smelling in it (mine had obviously had pickles in it before so this step was necessary).  \n    \n2\\. Fill mason jar 3/4 of the way full with heavy whipping cream. Screw the lid on very tightly.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrHGHffni1I/UCQ5wDh3gpI/AAAAAAAAA-w/-geZ39QZZLg/s640/P1018204.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrHGHffni1I/UCQ5wDh3gpI/AAAAAAAAA-w/-geZ39QZZLg/s1600/P1018204.JPG)  \n    \n    \n3\\. Shake vigorously for 20 minutes. Work those arm muscles!   \n    \n4\\. Open and look. There should be a buttery-looking substance floating in milky stuff. The milky stuff is buttercream (I can hear the lightbulbs turning on). Pour the buttercream out as best you can into a separate container.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iz0sj1sXqoU/UCQ5yAdupTI/AAAAAAAAA-4/VwENPpHunts/s640/P1018215.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iz0sj1sXqoU/UCQ5yAdupTI/AAAAAAAAA-4/VwENPpHunts/s1600/P1018215.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSCIJRoCTmo/UCQ5zWqBuaI/AAAAAAAAA_A/YGod5BQdfZc/s640/P1018256.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSCIJRoCTmo/UCQ5zWqBuaI/AAAAAAAAA_A/YGod5BQdfZc/s1600/P1018256.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NXrKV_0IRIo/UCQ50wRyGFI/AAAAAAAAA_I/5znh4brSt04/s640/P1018260.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NXrKV_0IRIo/UCQ50wRyGFI/AAAAAAAAA_I/5znh4brSt04/s1600/P1018260.JPG)  \n    \n    \n5\\.

Starting out as an adorable daisy when the cookie sales were aided by pigtails and grins missing front teeth, I made it all the way to a Senior Girl Scout, where, for the last two years we didn't even try to sell cookies. We just aren't the cute ones anymore.   \n    \nAnyway, my Girl Scout troop will be having our \"Final Hurrah\" party tonight to let things go out with a bang. We will laugh and cry over old pictures, remember camping trips, and do what we do best-- eat.   \n    \nEating for our troop has always been a joyous affair. When we went on camping trips, we probably spent at least 80% of our waking hours preparing, making, and cleaning our meals. Camping food is usually worth it, but there are always those failures that make for laughs later (campfire nachos? ashes-filled barbecue chicken?)  \n    \nA few years ago, I found a recipe for the Original Girl Scout Cookie, and I was very intrigued. This cookie was made by Girl Scouts only five years after Juliette Gordon Low started the organization.   \n    \nI decided our \"Final Hurrah\" would be a great time to have these cookies!  \n    \nFun fact: Girl Scout cookies are now $3.50 a box here, but when these were first sold in 1917 in a high school cafeteria, they were 25 cents a dozen (if they were still that, I think we can all agree we'd weigh about 500 pounds).   \n    \n### Original Girl Scout Sugar Cookies  \nI got the recipe from the [Girl Scout Website](http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/cookie_history/early_years.asp).   \nYield: 6-7 dozen thin cookies  \n    \n1 cup (2 sticks) butter (I used salted)  \n1 cup sugar  \n2 eggs  \n2 tbsp milk  \n1 tsp vanilla (they're sugar cookies so try to use clear if you have it)  \n2 cups flour  \n1 tsp salt  \n2 tsp baking powder  \n    \nSugar for topping, if desired  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PjWKBj2xMEQ/UBgPNtvWo8I/AAAAAAAAA5M/Eyml5wVGKYc/s640/IMG_2352.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PjWKBj2xMEQ/UBgPNtvWo8I/AAAAAAAAA5M/Eyml5wVGKYc/s1600/IMG_2352.JPG)  \n    \n    \n1\\.

Beat until it's mixed in fully.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6nYaQKVWf-Y/UBgPRiWJAyI/AAAAAAAAA5c/KFASGcBphAA/s640/IMG_2355.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6nYaQKVWf-Y/UBgPRiWJAyI/AAAAAAAAA5c/KFASGcBphAA/s1600/IMG_2355.jpg)  \n    \n_Double yolk!

That's normal.   \n    \n5\\. Refrigerate dough wrapped in plastic wrap for 1 hour.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Y9SoAKj85I/UBgPXHXfxyI/AAAAAAAAA54/EpDCkv-VaDo/s640/IMG_2361.PNG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Y9SoAKj85I/UBgPXHXfxyI/AAAAAAAAA54/EpDCkv-VaDo/s1600/IMG_2361.PNG)  \n    \n_Thanks, Siri!_  \nAt this point, I was looking through photos to bring to the party. I've decided to share this one for your viewing pleasure.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6wxxojsejgo/UBmTf2c287I/AAAAAAAAA6w/IOZZJPQMU_k/s640/IMG_2363.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6wxxojsejgo/UBmTf2c287I/AAAAAAAAA6w/IOZZJPQMU_k/s1600/IMG_2363.JPG)  \n    \n_Everyone at once: D'awwwwwwww!_  \n    \n6\\. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Roll out dough onto floured surface with floured rolling pin. Cut into trefoil shapes, or just 2\"-3\" circles. I bent a football cutter into the best trefoil I could make, because seriously, I do not need a football cookie cutter.   \n    \nKeep in mind this dough is SOFT. I had to roll it out and then freeze it for about 3-5 minutes before cutting it out, but that made it _so_ easy. I found the cookies did best if they were rolled out very thin. Sprinkle with sugar.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YUZ_HUI0hh4/UBmTdyiEH8I/AAAAAAAAA6o/DVb2vhGhFoQ/s640/IMG_2362.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YUZ_HUI0hh4/UBmTdyiEH8I/AAAAAAAAA6o/DVb2vhGhFoQ/s1600/IMG_2362.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f4djqgbLtrg/UBmTiKzUglI/AAAAAAAAA64/gc0xop1L6Fk/s640/IMG_2364.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f4djqgbLtrg/UBmTiKzUglI/AAAAAAAAA64/gc0xop1L6Fk/s1600/IMG_2364.jpg)  \n    \n_See how the cookie stays stiff on the spatula? It's frozen. _  \n    \n7\\. Bake on a silpat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet for 8-10 minutes (if _really_ thin, 6-7 minutes), or until golden around the edges.   \n    \nI baked the leftovers (did you really think I was going to waste those delicious little pieces?) and they made some really funny shapes. I burst out laughing when they came out of the oven.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N7BhM-5C9M0/UBmTiwIh0CI/AAAAAAAAA7A/uUbI7S-2WvQ/s640/IMG_2366.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N7BhM-5C9M0/UBmTiwIh0CI/AAAAAAAAA7A/uUbI7S-2WvQ/s1600/IMG_2366.JPG)  \n    \n_That takes skill._  \n    \nHere are the real ones:  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uYbPEwjSSHM/UBmTlaI5UZI/AAAAAAAAA7I/vKzHuz_B6L8/s640/IMG_2372.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uYbPEwjSSHM/UBmTlaI5UZI/AAAAAAAAA7I/vKzHuz_B6L8/s1600/IMG_2372.jpg)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E-cwlomIkss/UBmTnWBINXI/AAAAAAAAA7Q/ejABYwnpprg/s640/IMG_2373.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E-cwlomIkss/UBmTnWBINXI/AAAAAAAAA7Q/ejABYwnpprg/s1600/IMG_2373.jpg)  \n    \nWho else was a Girl Scout? How much were cookies when you sold?  \n    \nPeace out, Girl Scout."

I chose to do all of the above tonight.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dbByizlqz30/UBC0owH1ySI/AAAAAAAAAxE/_3ypir-dTsE/s640/IMG_2251.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dbByizlqz30/UBC0owH1ySI/AAAAAAAAAxE/_3ypir-dTsE/s1600/IMG_2251.JPG)  \n    \nThe best part? They were so simple! It's essentially just a fried Pate a Choux, and you know how friendly I am with Pate a Choux lately!  \n    \n### Mini French Crullers  \n### Adapted from [Use Real Butter](http://userealbutter.com/2012/03/09/french-cruller-doughnuts-recipe/).   \nYield- about 15 donuts  \n    \n1 cup water  \n6 tbsps (3 oz.) unsalted butter  \n2 tsps (10 g) sugar  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n1 cup (135 g) all-purpose flour  \n3 large eggs  \n2-3 egg whites, slightly beaten  \noil for frying (I used peanut oil), about 2 inches up the pan  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuvC4Hhv5A0/UBC0IxE7FnI/AAAAAAAAAvU/JP2A1kHsL7M/s640/IMG_2212.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuvC4Hhv5A0/UBC0IxE7FnI/AAAAAAAAAvU/JP2A1kHsL7M/s1600/IMG_2212.jpg)  \n    \n    \n1\\. Using heavy bottom pan, bring water, butter, sugar, and salt to a rapid boil over medium-high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wAGnzx_iwMI/UBC0KZiWt9I/AAAAAAAAAvc/E2jowVyfSpI/s640/IMG_2213.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wAGnzx_iwMI/UBC0KZiWt9I/AAAAAAAAAvc/E2jowVyfSpI/s1600/IMG_2213.jpg)  \n    \n2\\. Add flour, all at once, to the mixture. Stir rapidly to get flour clumps out. When a film begins to coat the bottom of the pan, turn heat off. You can see if a film is developing by scraping the bottom of the pan with the wooden spoon.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GHHbyZNCE88/UBC7qnUEFQI/AAAAAAAAAyU/H70qvZIxysU/s640/IMG_2216.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GHHbyZNCE88/UBC7qnUEFQI/AAAAAAAAAyU/H70qvZIxysU/s1600/IMG_2216.jpg)  \n    \n    \n3\\. Stir for a minute or two to cool it down. Add the whole eggs, one at a time, incorporating thoroughly in between eggs. Add the egg whites and make sure everything is fully incorporated.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IcBwObdD0Eg/UBC0S_KJ1eI/AAAAAAAAAv0/y25QMPkrTRI/s640/IMG_2218.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IcBwObdD0Eg/UBC0S_KJ1eI/AAAAAAAAAv0/y25QMPkrTRI/s1600/IMG_2218.jpg)  \n    \n4\\. Turn the oil on to heat up. Put the dough into a gallon ziplock fastened with a 1/2 inch star tip. Cut 3\"x3\" parchment squares and butter each thoroughly.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sGyLKC6vdXs/UBC0WjhPxMI/AAAAAAAAAwI/0prcMKBXf9M/s640/IMG_2225.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sGyLKC6vdXs/UBC0WjhPxMI/AAAAAAAAAwI/0prcMKBXf9M/s1600/IMG_2225.jpg)  \n    \n5\\. Pipe 2\"-3\" circles, making sure to barely overlap. If you overlap too much, they will be lopsided.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RrnKuFvWICI/UBC0hh3FnqI/AAAAAAAAAws/HMxeOT6skqU/s640/IMG_2231.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RrnKuFvWICI/UBC0hh3FnqI/AAAAAAAAAws/HMxeOT6skqU/s1600/IMG_2231.jpg)  \n    \n6\\. Test a little piece of the dough to see if the oil is ready. If it is, gently place one of the squares dough-side down. The parchment paper will come off by itself. Take it out of the water with tongs (unless you just happen to love the interior decor of the Emergency Room- then you can use your hands). Flip the donut over when the bottom side seems golden brown enough.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ydly-HD_2OY/UBC0eiCM2wI/AAAAAAAAAwk/dWHwA5UdFYY/s640/IMG_2230.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ydly-HD_2OY/UBC0eiCM2wI/AAAAAAAAAwk/dWHwA5UdFYY/s1600/IMG_2230.jpg)  \n    \n7\\. After frying both sides, take the donut out and place on paper towels. Dip in glaze, dust with powdered sugar, or eat plain!   \n    \n8\\. Repeat step seven until you've gained 5 pounds.   \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vrockKZE0Rs/UBC2mtLtz0I/AAAAAAAAAxY/UKX9Cy-3UnM/s640/IMG_2256.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vrockKZE0Rs/UBC2mtLtz0I/AAAAAAAAAxY/UKX9Cy-3UnM/s1600/IMG_2256.jpg)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O52bN8qu2gg/UBC3VZRjXZI/AAAAAAAAAx0/ToB4NT_HD6o/s640/IMG_2264.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O52bN8qu2gg/UBC3VZRjXZI/AAAAAAAAAx0/ToB4NT_HD6o/s1600/IMG_2264.JPG)  \n    \n_This one is filled with fresh peaches and drizzled with fresh blueberry reduction... Oh man my keyboard has drool all over it!_  \nGet creative and enjoy!"

Hands down.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wb8ZH6HdQKo/UA36wMId0_I/AAAAAAAAAuw/Eo22cPTb12s/s640/IMG_2179.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wb8ZH6HdQKo/UA36wMId0_I/AAAAAAAAAuw/Eo22cPTb12s/s1600/IMG_2179.JPG)  \n    \n    \nThere are two types of French bread: the traditional crusty baguette, and the soft, tender french loaf.   \n    \nMy personal favorite is the softer bread. I love making sandwiches on it, and I love enjoying it warm with butter. Mmmm... butter.   \n    \nBread is my true love. I've been feeling so inspired, I even wrote a bread haiku:  \n    \nBread, thou art tasty,  \nso delicious on my lips  \nbut not on my hips.   \n    \nI am a firm believer in eating everything in moderation. No food is \"bad\" for you. The problem is when I bake bread, I eat the whole loaf by myself!   \n    \nWhen I found this recipe, I decided I couldn't resist. It was described as \"soft\" and \"dense\"! How could I resist?!  \n    \nThe recipe I used was adapted from [Mel's Kitchen Cafe](http://www.melskitchencafe.com/2008/07/french-bread.html).   \n    \n### Soft French Bread  \nYield: 2 loaves  \n    \nThis recipe takes about 2 hours from start to finish.   \n    \n2 1/4 cup warm water (warm to the touch- a little warmer than your finger)  \n2 tbsp sugar  \n1 tbsp active dry yeast  \n1 tbsp salt  \n2 tbsp oil (I used veggie oil)  \n5 3/4 cup all purpose flour  \n    \n1 egg  \n1 tsp water  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-43WlPD0-_6E/UA3Ecq9vukI/AAAAAAAAAsY/PWKfW1KhuZI/s640/IMG_2142.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-43WlPD0-_6E/UA3Ecq9vukI/AAAAAAAAAsY/PWKfW1KhuZI/s1600/IMG_2142.JPG)  \n    \n    \n1\\. Add sugar and yeast to the warm water and stir with a wooden spoon for about 5 seconds or until the major clumps are gone. Let it sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TppkyS8eJq8/UA3EhiMxYOI/AAAAAAAAAsg/X4NstgHzHng/s640/IMG_2143.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TppkyS8eJq8/UA3EhiMxYOI/AAAAAAAAAsg/X4NstgHzHng/s1600/IMG_2143.jpg)  \n    \n    \n2\\. Pour the yeast mixture into your mixer and add salt, oil, and about half the flour. Using the paddle attachment, mix until just incorporated. Add the remaining flour and mix for about 15 seconds. Switch to the dough hook and mix for 6 minutes.   \n    \n3\\. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on for 15 seconds to stir it down. Repeat this step for a total of 5 times. (for a total of about 50 minutes)  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FNqIuK4fy1E/UA3ElUfKFJI/AAAAAAAAAso/KDhlY5uO6qo/s640/IMG_2144.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FNqIuK4fy1E/UA3ElUfKFJI/AAAAAAAAAso/KDhlY5uO6qo/s1600/IMG_2144.jpg)  \n    \n    \n4\\. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Cut dough in half. Roll each dough into a 9x13 inch rectangle. Roll up (so it will be 13 inches not 9 inches) and place on silpat (or parchment) lined baking sheet, seam side down. Tuck the ends under slightly so the \"spiral\" end doesn't show. Using a sharp knife, slice three shallow gashes on the diagonal.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XYY3ySx0KI0/UA3EtunInMI/AAAAAAAAAs8/L4mJlujttsw/s640/IMG_2146.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XYY3ySx0KI0/UA3EtunInMI/AAAAAAAAAs8/L4mJlujttsw/s1600/IMG_2146.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XQycVFn0XZ8/UA3GP_OgZ3I/AAAAAAAAAtE/2wqeXb4CfMs/s640/IMG_2147.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XQycVFn0XZ8/UA3GP_OgZ3I/AAAAAAAAAtE/2wqeXb4CfMs/s1600/IMG_2147.jpg)  \n    \n    \n    \n5\\.

Top with powdered sugar or chocolate sauce.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1GoDGMIDrQM/UAySERmuV-I/AAAAAAAAAr0/y6ypanK9uEo/s640/IMG_2138.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1GoDGMIDrQM/UAySERmuV-I/AAAAAAAAAr0/y6ypanK9uEo/s1600/IMG_2138.JPG)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTQchRSfUcE/UAySFDgqnSI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n4chaTbMnZg/s640/IMG_2139.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTQchRSfUcE/UAySFDgqnSI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n4chaTbMnZg/s1600/IMG_2139.JPG)  \n    \n_Yum... just yum. _"

Other than Lembas Bread, Rabbit Stew, and countless potato dishes (\"Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew!\"), I found virtually nothing. Nothing was party appropriate.   \n    \nSo on went my thinking cap.   \n    \nI decided to make The One Ring cookies and Lembas Bread inspired cookies.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h7TbexbF9Vs/UAGfpq8t3KI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/BYuSCqw04QA/s640/blogger-image-1428001315.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h7TbexbF9Vs/UAGfpq8t3KI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/BYuSCqw04QA/s1600/blogger-image-1428001315.jpg)  \n    \n_What's Lembas Bread, you ask?_  \n    \nLembas Bread- (n) elven waybread with magical powers of satiation; one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man  \n    \n![](http://briellecostumes.typepad.com/.a/6a0134804df3cb970c015392eb7aa2970b-800wi)  \n    \n_The elves eat it._   \n    \nI didn't want to just made flat bread, so I made cookies that looked like the leaf wrappings.   \n    \n    \nI used one batch of sugar cookie dough to make all The One Rings and the Lembas Bread.   \n    \nThis recipe is especially great because it requires no refrigeration.   \n    \n    \nLembas Bread/One Ring Sugar Cookies  \n    \nYield: 3-4 dozen depending on size and thickness (This is my aunt's recipe and she has been known to get 10 dozen cookies out of this recipe)  \n    \n1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened  \n1 cup sugar   \n1 egg  \n1 tsp vanilla (clear preferably)  \n1 tsp baking powder  \n3 1/2 cups flour, plus more for rolling  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line cookie sheets with either Silpat (SUCH a life saver!) or parchment paper.   \n    \n2\\. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Scrape bowl.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2VPV7H4if3g/UAGflnjiivI/AAAAAAAAAkM/dR22MvQKlQE/s320/blogger-image--194032384.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2VPV7H4if3g/UAGflnjiivI/AAAAAAAAAkM/dR22MvQKlQE/s1600/blogger-image--194032384.jpg)[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PF9Ys3h4j_g/UAGfnyjju9I/AAAAAAAAAk0/cG_RfFoeFow/s320/blogger-image--1565418162.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PF9Ys3h4j_g/UAGfnyjju9I/AAAAAAAAAk0/cG_RfFoeFow/s1600/blogger-image--1565418162.jpg)  \n    \nLeft is \"incorporated\" and right is \"fluffy\"  \n    \n    \n3\\. Add egg and vanilla. Scrape bowl. (notice a trend here?)  \n    \n4\\. Mix baking powder and flour together before adding it in three parts to the wet ingredients. Mix until fully incorporated and it's in big chunks.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OO8ASmo4SFM/UAGfp_stqYI/AAAAAAAAAlc/zPM_v45riVM/s640/blogger-image--951974174.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OO8ASmo4SFM/UAGfp_stqYI/AAAAAAAAAlc/zPM_v45riVM/s1600/blogger-image--951974174.jpg)  \n    \n    \n5\\. Divide cookie dough in half or thirds, depending on how much space you have to roll out. Flour the counter. Roll out the first chunk into 1/4 inch dough. You can change the thickness, but just remember to change your baking time accordingly.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BVHU5LZI_Cw/UAGfqqWNZnI/AAAAAAAAAls/BMO8rY8qE6Y/s640/blogger-image--826311449.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BVHU5LZI_Cw/UAGfqqWNZnI/AAAAAAAAAls/BMO8rY8qE6Y/s1600/blogger-image--826311449.jpg)  \n    \n    \n6\\. Cut out the desired shapes. to make the lembas bread, I used a football cookie cutter and used a knife to make the leafy slash marks. To make The One Ring, I used a round cookie cutter for the outside and cut out the inside with a medicine bottle cap. Using a metal spatula, transfer cookies from the counter to the silpat/baking sheet. Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes or until golden around the edges.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ge2KPhqugp0/UAGfkvj5zrI/AAAAAAAAAj0/JoYIn0hjKO8/s640/blogger-image-968133204.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ge2KPhqugp0/UAGfkvj5zrI/AAAAAAAAAj0/JoYIn0hjKO8/s1600/blogger-image-968133204.jpg)  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lw04-0VUBRw/UAGfo2R0JmI/AAAAAAAAAlE/SPHT7F3qSpE/s640/blogger-image-394187317.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lw04-0VUBRw/UAGfo2R0JmI/AAAAAAAAAlE/SPHT7F3qSpE/s1600/blogger-image-394187317.jpg)  \n    \n_The precious! We wants one, yes we do. _  \n    \n7\\. Frost cookies however you want. Sometimes when I'm crunched for time, I take a tub of Pillsbury (or the like) frosting, NON-WHIPPED, and microwave it for 20-30 seconds. When it's really thin, I barely dip the front of the cookies in it, and it acts just like royal icing! It dries pretty quickly, about 30 minutes. Just make sure they're completely dry before you stack them.   \n    \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KyzXAyWnWb0/UAGfkNY-35I/AAAAAAAAAjs/WpjdgxO_CGQ/s640/blogger-image--1219375784.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KyzXAyWnWb0/UAGfkNY-35I/AAAAAAAAAjs/WpjdgxO_CGQ/s1600/blogger-image--1219375784.jpg)  \n    \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DX-8ptF7FI0/UAGfk3IfZcI/AAAAAAAAAj8/1DbdsU4NuTY/s320/blogger-image--1414102059.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DX-8ptF7FI0/UAGfk3IfZcI/AAAAAAAAAj8/1DbdsU4NuTY/s1600/blogger-image--1414102059.jpg)  \n    \n_Legolas Greenleaf approves. _  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sfV_nzom2pU/UAGfpFImnPI/AAAAAAAAAlI/4Rig2WRaOIY/s640/blogger-image--45972048.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sfV_nzom2pU/UAGfpFImnPI/AAAAAAAAAlI/4Rig2WRaOIY/s1600/blogger-image--45972048.jpg)  \n    \nOne small bite should fill the stomach of a grown man.   \n    \nI've eaten four... what does that say about me?  \n    \n![](http://www.pagepulp.com/wp-content/gollum_angry.jpg)  \n    \n_Stupid, fat hobbit!_"

        "markdown": "I have a dear friend named Cupcake.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iRYChUQsCxA/UABDSs7xPsI/AAAAAAAAAiU/JPBR81Y74GU/s640/blogger-image-2095650222.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iRYChUQsCxA/UABDSs7xPsI/AAAAAAAAAiU/JPBR81Y74GU/s1600/blogger-image-2095650222.jpg)  \n    \nWe've been apart for a little while in order for me to continue my love affair with bread, but my heart has always been with Cupcake.   \n    \nI've missed her so.   \n    \nCupcake was one of my first baking friends, and I worked for years to perfect our relationship.   \n    \nShe is so sweet, but not fake, you know? She's all genuine.   \n    \nWe had to take a break when my family forbade her from entering my house, for they said she was sabotaging their figures.   \n    \nBut she's back.   \n    \n### Italian Cream Cupcakes  \n#### Yield: 6 cupcakes   \n1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp flour  \n3/4 tsp baking powder  \npinch of salt  \n6 tbsp sugar  \n3 tbsp butter, room temperature  \n1 large egg  \n1/2 tsp vanilla  \n1/4 cup heavy cream (or half and half)  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 350 fahrenheit (I used a toaster oven which always seems to overheat, so I heated my oven to 300)  \n    \n2\\. Line a 6-cup muffin pan with paper liners  \n    \n3\\. In a bowl or mixer, beat the sugar and butter until it's light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat until incorporated throughout. Scrape the bowl and beat for 15 more seconds.  \n    \n4\\. Quickly mix the flour, baking powder, and salt in a dry ingredients bowl. Mix this in with the butter/sugar alternately with the heavy cream. Beat until no flour is visible, making sure to scrape the bowl often. **Don't overbeat!**  \n5\\. Scoop batter into the prepared cupcake liners. Spray a cookie scoop with cooking spray so the batter is easily removed. Divide batter evenly (Or, if you're me, you divide batter so they're all equal except one is giant and you claim that one as soon as they leave the oven).   \n    \n6\\. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool on a drying rack (If you're impatient or time-crunched like me, you can refrigerate them on the rack for 15 minutes).  \n    \n#### Cream Cheese Frosting  \n4 oz (half a package) of cream cheese (I used cold, but you can use room temperature)  \n2 tbsp butter, softened  \n1 tsp clear vanilla  \n1 tbsp milk  \n2-3 cups of powdered sugar, to taste  \n  \n1\\. Beat cream cheese and butter until incorporated. Scrape bowl.  \n  \n2\\. Add vanilla and milk.  \n  \n3\\. Slowly add powdered sugar until it seems right to you.  \n    \n#### Assembling the Cupcakes  \n1\\. Cut the corner (1/4 inch from the very tip) of a sturdy ziplock baggie, sandwich or quart sized. Put the tip in the hole (you can use a coupler, I just hate washing them).  \n  \n2\\. Put the baggie in a glass or cup with the top folded over the lips of the cup to make it easier to fill. Fill the bag.  \n  \n3\\. Frost cupcakes however you desire.  \n  \n4\\. Put coconut in thin layer on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 3 minutes or toast in toaster oven for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.  \n  \n5\\. Put the coconut in your hand and quickly press it along the outer rim of the frosting on the cupcakes.  \n  \n6\\. Garnish cupcakes with one roasted pecan and a chocolate curl.  \n    \n#### Chocolate Curls   \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n8tSj9iqA_o/UABDYSxaiXI/AAAAAAAAAjM/KS7aAvYnLKo/s640/blogger-image--1398453105.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n8tSj9iqA_o/UABDYSxaiXI/AAAAAAAAAjM/KS7aAvYnLKo/s1600/blogger-image--1398453105.jpg)  \n    \n1\\. Melt 1/2 cup chocolate chips with 1/2 tsp vegetable oil.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QCS346uSaAA/UABDTTTTY3I/AAAAAAAAAic/KUMVdiIUACc/s640/blogger-image-1069140362.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QCS346uSaAA/UABDTTTTY3I/AAAAAAAAAic/KUMVdiIUACc/s1600/blogger-image-1069140362.jpg)  \n    \n    \n2\\.

Let it cool, trying to let it do so at room temperature and not in the refrigerator.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1aJu-Tq3L8s/UABDV5QVCZI/AAAAAAAAAis/R5E40PJENwE/s640/blogger-image--1698246175.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1aJu-Tq3L8s/UABDV5QVCZI/AAAAAAAAAis/R5E40PJENwE/s1600/blogger-image--1698246175.jpg)  \n    \n    \n4\\. Using a cool and flat spatula at a 45 degree angle, start at the edge and scrape it, letting it curl as you go.   \n    \n5\\.

        "markdown": "The dinner I made last night made my parents really, really sad that I'm leaving to go to college soon.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lG0jXWep10U/T_xaHXGwdeI/AAAAAAAAAc0/T8raEILV9OE/s640/blogger-image-1199245569.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lG0jXWep10U/T_xaHXGwdeI/AAAAAAAAAc0/T8raEILV9OE/s1600/blogger-image-1199245569.jpg)  \n    \nDad even asked if I could make enough meals to freeze to last them until the next time I'm home.   \n    \nIt seems every time my mom sends me to the store with her credit card to pick up one thing for her (sugar free Bluebell Strawberry ice cream... always), I'll usually pick up for myself a little box of Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry.   \n    \nThis stuff is like pure gold.   \n    \n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/luuux-original-files/bookmarklet_uploaded/pepperidgefarm.jpg)  \n    \n_What's that noise? Oh, yeah. It's the sound of angels singing. _  \n    \nPuff Pastry is one of those magical things that essentially makes a meal, with almost no effort at all. Adding Puff Pastry to anything makes it look instantly fancy and time-consuming. Let's keep that our little secret.   \n    \nDad asked for \"something different and creative\" for dinner last night, so I took myself out of that little metaphorical box and thought of something.   \n    \n### Mushroom, Onion, and Pepper Jack Tarts  \n#### AKA Magic Tarts  \nYield: 9 three inch tarts  \n    \n2 tbsp olive oil   \n1 tbsp butter  \n1/2 cup chopped white onion  \n2 cloves garlic, chopped  \n1 cup chopped mushroom (any variety, I used shiitake and baby bella together)  \n1/4 cup chicken broth  \n1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese  \n1 egg  \n1 tbsp half and half (or milk or cream)  \n1 Sheet Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry, thawed (if your local store has generic brand I'm really jealous. I've never found anything even close to Pepperidge Farm) The box comes with two sheets, but this recipe only needs one.   \n    \n1\\. In a pan on low-medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil. Saute the onion and garlic until the onion is grilled (a little brown on the edges)  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GwaOBIO_lLo/T_xaLq8A0QI/AAAAAAAAAdk/lF7e9oFudaU/s640/blogger-image--193719662.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GwaOBIO_lLo/T_xaLq8A0QI/AAAAAAAAAdk/lF7e9oFudaU/s1600/blogger-image--193719662.jpg)  \n    \n    \n2\\. Add the mushroom and chicken broth. Simmer until the chicken broth is evaporated. (15 minutes)  \n    \n3\\. Open up the trifold Puff Pastry. Using a biscuit cutter, cut out nine circles.   \n    \n4\\. Beat the egg and half and half together. Using a pastry brush, brush a little of the egg wash on each circle of Puff Pastry.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rhKgEsl_Ru0/T_xaIkY5KAI/AAAAAAAAAdE/EIXUWfXKp7E/s640/blogger-image--298544218.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rhKgEsl_Ru0/T_xaIkY5KAI/AAAAAAAAAdE/EIXUWfXKp7E/s1600/blogger-image--298544218.jpg)  \n    \n5\\.

Magnifique!\" _  \n    \nThere's something truly magical about France. I'm not quite sure what it is. Perhaps it's the relaxed mood of the country as a whole, or maybe it's the country's love affair with eating well. Whatever it is, I am proud to call myself a Francophile.   \n    \nI went to Paris for a week when I was 8 years old, and this was where the love affair with all things French began. The one thing I very vividly remember about Paris was the crêpes.  \n    \nThe chef would pour the thin batter onto a large, flat grill, and spread it out with some little utensil that looked like a miniature broom scraper. The crêpes were _huge_.   \n    \nThis past week, my dad went on a 9 day business trip to France. Raise your hand if you feel sorry for him.   \n    \n_Yeah, I didn't think so._   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H1wCwJ3Uk6I/T_CY6Z_ChLI/AAAAAAAAAO0/_Uy419prA2A/s640/blogger-image--589251599.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H1wCwJ3Uk6I/T_CY6Z_ChLI/AAAAAAAAAO0/_Uy419prA2A/s1600/blogger-image--589251599.jpg)  \n    \n_He went to Nice mostly. Look, everyone's wearing tops! Whooda thunk it?!_  \nWell, upon his return from France, I thought it would be nice (see what I did there?) to make him some crêpes. I'm sure he was sick of French food by then, but who doesn't love a good crêpe?  \n    \n### French Crêpes  \n#### Makes 15  9\" crêpes or 20  6\" crêpes  \n1 cup all purpose flour  \n1 tsp white sugar  \n1/4 tsp salt  \n3 eggs  \n2 cups milk (I use skim, but whatever's in the fridge will work)  \n2 tbsp butter, melted  \nbutter for pan (Use real butter. This is French food. Cooking spray is highly frowned upon.)  \n    \nNote: If you're making only dessert crêpes, you can use up to 2 tbsp of sugar to make a sweeter crêpe.   \n    \n1\\. Mix together eggs and milk. They need to warm up to room temperature. In the meantime, melt the butter, and let it get down to room temperature, too. You don't want the butter to solidify in the batter.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wziy2FFN_0o/T-981Goh4QI/AAAAAAAAANs/_XCFI2gUyNI/s640/blogger-image--631315532.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wziy2FFN_0o/T-981Goh4QI/AAAAAAAAANs/_XCFI2gUyNI/s1600/blogger-image--631315532.jpg)  \n    \n    \n2\\. Mix flour, sugar, and salt. Sift.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jKQpA47tTvo/T-981x06QZI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ChHSzk3EHrE/s640/blogger-image-347755724.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jKQpA47tTvo/T-981x06QZI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ChHSzk3EHrE/s1600/blogger-image-347755724.jpg)  \n    \n    \n3\\. Making sure the wet ingredients are all at room temperature, mix the butter with the egg/milk mixture. Add dry ingredients slowly, while stirring constantly. When it's all added in, I tap the bowl on the counter a few times to get out any major bubbles.  \n    \n4\\. Now run all of the batter through the sift, making sure to throw out any stubborn flour clumps. Do this twice.  \n    \n5\\. Turn the stove on medium heat and let the pan heat up for about a minute. You can check to see if the pan is properly heated by getting a cup of water, wetting your fingers, and sprinkling some of the water on the pan. If the water quickly sizzles away, the pan is heated up. If the water sits there not bubbling, the pan isn't hot enough yet.   \n    \n6\\. After _generously_ buttering the bottom and sides of the pan, use a small measuring cup (about 3 tbsp for the 9\" or 2 tbsp for the 6\") to transfer the batter into the buttered pan. **Quickly** lift the pan off the burner and tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter around the bottom of the pan.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qDUe2KG06eQ/T-981snbqdI/AAAAAAAAAN0/C7pn77S3x4E/s640/blogger-image--1105946954.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qDUe2KG06eQ/T-981snbqdI/AAAAAAAAAN0/C7pn77S3x4E/s1600/blogger-image--1105946954.jpg)  \n    \n_This is my setup. Most of the butter was gone by the time I finished. _  \n    \n7\\. After anywhere from 15-30 seconds (depending on the size and thickness), the middle of the crêpe will appear dry on top (much like when cooking American pancakes). Use a nonmetal spatula (so as to not ruin the nonstick surface of the pan) to flip the crêpe.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkrhGeaerMI/T-9805jmTzI/AAAAAAAAANk/KpSd6hmoyik/s640/blogger-image--1216210356.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkrhGeaerMI/T-9805jmTzI/AAAAAAAAANk/KpSd6hmoyik/s1600/blogger-image--1216210356.jpg)  \n    \n_This crêpe is still wet in the middle.

Same recipe, different fruit._  \nYou may have noticed I'm on a tart craze. There's something about summer that makes tarts irresistible to me. They're so light and fruity- perfect for cooling off on a summer day.   \n    \nThis year, my dad will be out of town for Father's day, so we are celebrating our favorite daddy early. Allow me to make the biggest understatement of the year-- my dad _loves_ peaches. He has a list of favorite foods and I believe it goes as follows:  \n    \n1\\. Peaches  \n2\\. Toasted pecans  \n3\\. Sweet potato fries  \n    \nSo when it comes to Father's day, we try to stick to the basic loves of his food life. Since Father's day is always during peach season, we usually take our annual trip to the local orchard a few days before Father's day in order to make my mom's delicious peach cobbler. This year, my dad decided he would rather have a peach tart now and a peach cobbler later on. I was excited to take on the challenge.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ubt-B8HzdFU/T9Ysdx-tdgI/AAAAAAAAAII/lS8xZa5hIQg/s640/photo+3.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ubt-B8HzdFU/T9Ysdx-tdgI/AAAAAAAAAII/lS8xZa5hIQg/s1600/photo+3.JPG)  \n    \n_Mmmm... peaches! _  \nUnfortunately, there were about a million moths in the orchard which kept attacking me and my innocent family. We did manage, despite the moths' wishes, to bring home about 16 pounds of delicious peaches. Another good part of the orchard is you're allowed to eat as much as you want while you're there. My (_ahem_) strenuous  peach picking caused me to work up enough of an appetite to eat three peaches while I was there.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JZlL4dh17DU/T9Ysm782l7I/AAAAAAAAAIY/gHMF05IFDP4/s640/photo+5.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JZlL4dh17DU/T9Ysm782l7I/AAAAAAAAAIY/gHMF05IFDP4/s1600/photo+5.JPG)  \n    \n_Look at those big boys!_  \nI made a small peach tart two days ago for my dad as a \"test run\" (snack) because I had a little extra dough left from my apple tart.  \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fCzhBh1rvtU/T9ZOOpPqeRI/AAAAAAAAAJI/QvZMV1BVlhc/s640/photo+5.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fCzhBh1rvtU/T9ZOOpPqeRI/AAAAAAAAAJI/QvZMV1BVlhc/s1600/photo+5.JPG)  \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Aiym2h6POM/T9ZOWdP0aXI/AAAAAAAAAJw/YMZ5fmhnJVQ/s640/photo+4.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Aiym2h6POM/T9ZOWdP0aXI/AAAAAAAAAJw/YMZ5fmhnJVQ/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n_Pretty as a peach!_  \nThe recipe for the tart can be found [here](/2012/06/french-country-apple-tart.html).   \nIt took 35 minutes for my peach tart to bake.   \n    \nI thought it was delicious, but if you don't trust me yet, you can take my dad's word for it...  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIGlVk0f2-g/T9ZVzcvgMXI/AAAAAAAAAKk/KTPui3MtkNc/s320/photo+(32).JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIGlVk0f2-g/T9ZVzcvgMXI/AAAAAAAAAKk/KTPui3MtkNc/s1600/photo+(32).JPG)  \n    \n_I think he may like it. _"

Aaah!_  \nWho doesn't love a good summer tart? With the sweet dough crusts, delicious fillings, and ever-beautiful presentations, they are always a crowd favorite.   \nWe happened to have a few apples laying around that were a little past their prime, so I decided to bake up a little tart to bring to my friend Emily's house. While this tart looks so impressive, it really doesn't take long! It's a gorgeous, no-fuss tart. The taste is out of this world, and the tight pattern of apples will leave guests (or even just family) wowing. I've brought it on many a picnic and it's always eaten up within minutes.   \n    \nThis recipe is in two parts because there is one hour of refrigeration required in between making the dough and making the tart. Don't leave this refrigeration out! If you do, the dough will be too soft and it will bake differently.   \n    \n### French Country Apple Tart  \nAdapted from the \"From A French Country Kitchen\" cookbook  \n    \n**Sweet Tart Dough**  \n    \n1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar  \n1 1/4 cups all purpose flour  \n1 egg  \n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, cut into small pieces, chilled (the recipe calls for unsalted, but I always use salted butter)  \n    \n1\\. Mix the sugar and flour together in a bowl. Form a depression in the center and add the egg and butter.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nKKuxO1gUfE/T9PIesma-AI/AAAAAAAAAFo/B7iiPIQ06Ew/s640/photo+5.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nKKuxO1gUfE/T9PIesma-AI/AAAAAAAAAFo/B7iiPIQ06Ew/s1600/photo+5.JPG)  \n    \n    \n2\\. \"Fork\" the egg and butter into the dry ingredients by rapidly pressing and sliding the fork along the bowl. It will take a few minutes. You'll get your arm workout in, as well. You can add cold water (a tiny bit) if the dough is too dry, but this has never been a problem for me.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6PqN3YWfWHU/T9PIZCmfS6I/AAAAAAAAAEo/j3T4e5GG9Ds/s640/photo+2.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6PqN3YWfWHU/T9PIZCmfS6I/AAAAAAAAAEo/j3T4e5GG9Ds/s1600/photo+2.JPG)  \n    \n_Just think of the triceps you'll have!_  \n    \n3\\. Form a ball with your hands and chill in wax paper, parchment paper, or plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.  \n    \n**Apple Tart**  \n1 recipe sweet tart dough  \n1 1/4 pounds tart apples  \n1/2 tsp cinnamon  \n8 tbsp (1 stick) butter (again, I used salted)  \n4 tbsp granulated sugar  \n1 whole egg  \n  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJiB_cLquFM/T9PIZ3h3qRI/AAAAAAAAAEw/L3-iODpkrCY/s640/photo+3.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJiB_cLquFM/T9PIZ3h3qRI/AAAAAAAAAEw/L3-iODpkrCY/s1600/photo+3.JPG)  \n    \n1\\. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.   \n    \n2\\. Press dough into a tart pan (mine is 9x9) or roll out onto a cookie sheet or baking stone. If rolling out onto a pan without sides, be sure to bake \"barriers\" of dough, like a pizza crust, so the juices don't overflow.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-puh_ygpmiBM/T9PIcXxXRbI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/YwDf8fuZpNM/s400/photo+2.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-puh_ygpmiBM/T9PIcXxXRbI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/YwDf8fuZpNM/s1600/photo+2.JPG)  \n    \n_Squish, squish, squish!_  \n    \n3\\. Using a fork, poke holes in the bottom of the tart dough to prevent puffing of the dough. Bake for ten minutes.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F1mLxLYFCiA/T9PIcwesuyI/AAAAAAAAAFY/j693B1-yIhU/s640/photo+3.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F1mLxLYFCiA/T9PIcwesuyI/AAAAAAAAAFY/j693B1-yIhU/s1600/photo+3.JPG)  \n    \n_Fork, fork, fork!_  \n    \n4\\.

Slice apples _very_ thin, making sure to exclude any seeds or the icky hard pieces in the core.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GT9obpe8XmU/T9PIb-fqXmI/AAAAAAAAAFI/xsXZ9vISXgA/s640/photo+1.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GT9obpe8XmU/T9PIb-fqXmI/AAAAAAAAAFI/xsXZ9vISXgA/s1600/photo+1.JPG)  \n    \n_I peeled two apples keeping the peels each in one piece. Applause, please. _  \n    \n    \n6\\. Arrange apple slices in decorative, tight circular patterns.   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1t4o3SesLSA/T9PId8DwzdI/AAAAAAAAAFg/N-JmWjvgOZo/s640/photo+4.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1t4o3SesLSA/T9PId8DwzdI/AAAAAAAAAFg/N-JmWjvgOZo/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n    \n_The middle kind of looks like a bird. This was unintentional. But seriously, isn't this gorgeous?_  \n    \n    \n7\\. Melt butter over low heat, making sure not to brown it. Remove from heat and add the sugar, stirring until it dissolves. Let it cool down a little bit, and add the egg, beating until it's pretty smooth.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3O-LG-F7tW8/T9PIaScVj0I/AAAAAAAAAE4/CqPH3KDbDYg/s640/photo+4.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3O-LG-F7tW8/T9PIaScVj0I/AAAAAAAAAE4/CqPH3KDbDYg/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n    \n_Mmmm... sugar-butter-egg goop!_  \n    \n8\\. Sprinkle cinnamon on the apple tart and pour the sugar-butter-egg mixture over all the apples. Try to cover all the apples. Bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes or until the fruit is tender. (or you can be like me and forget to turn the oven on and sit for 30 minutes wondering why the fruit isn't tender).   \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6nugd_kzypk/T9QACr6YvpI/AAAAAAAAAGA/s4lSMKqOEAE/s640/photo+(30).JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6nugd_kzypk/T9QACr6YvpI/AAAAAAAAAGA/s4lSMKqOEAE/s1600/photo+(30).JPG)  \n    \n_That was painless, wasn't it?! And look at this beautiful result! Everyone together- \"Oooh! Aaah!\"_  \nExcuse me while I eat my weight in tarts.   \n    \nLove,  \nNea"

        "markdown": "I've updated this post [here](/2012/08/macaroni-grill-rosemary-bread-update.html) with better pictures and a few updates on my method for making this bread. Check it out!   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2D-KkV3DpXY/VB5fboox0WI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/gAhVspKXy1o/s1600/P1018475.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2D-KkV3DpXY/VB5fboox0WI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/gAhVspKXy1o/s1600/P1018475.JPG)  \n    \nCan I just say that I love carbs? I recently tried the Dukan Diet, which celebrities like Kate Middleton and J.Lo have done, and I didn't last three days. My breaking point was at the mall when my protein-filled stomach cried as I passed the Cinnamonster, and... well... I couldn't say no. The aroma of cinnamon, butter, and yeast entered my nose. The diet ended there.    \n    \nMy personal favorite flour-filled food is the rosemary bread from Macaroni Grill. The crispy crust and tender inside combine to make the most delicious bread my mouth has ever tasted. Every time I go to Macaroni Grill, I always ask for three loaves to-go so I can make what my dad calls my \"Magical Sandwich,\" which consists of basil pesto, sun-dried tomato pesto, pepperoni, two types of cheese, and of course, butter. That recipe will come later.   \n    \nNow it's not often I get the opportunity to bake in the summer. Here in Texas, with sweltering 100+ degree days even in June, baking can heat the whole house up, making it a no-go.    \n    \nBut when I found out today was going to be rainy and cool (Whew! We all needed a break!), I _leapt_ at the opportunity to bake the Macaroni Grill bread I found on [Jamie Cooks It Up](http://jamiecooksitup.blogspot.com/2010/03/macaroni-grill-bread.html)! All I can say is... **_wow_**.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0bns8dS4q4g/T9EpRCD-lbI/AAAAAAAAACo/neUrMu9EF7g/s640/photo+2.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0bns8dS4q4g/T9EpRCD-lbI/AAAAAAAAACo/neUrMu9EF7g/s1600/photo+2.JPG)  \n    \n_The butter! The salt! The fresh rosemary! The glory!_  \nThis bread was actually _very_ easy. It's a really quick recipe, excluding the total 55 minutes of rising, so it can be made while you're doing other things (like watching Gilmore Girls on a beautiful rainy day).   \n    \nI also got to use up some of the rosemary from my herb garden I've been growing.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WAkROZ7wcuk/T9EqGOOSTRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/gZvW7QVnT-A/s640/photo+2.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WAkROZ7wcuk/T9EqGOOSTRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/gZvW7QVnT-A/s1600/photo+2.JPG)  \n    \n_I think I have enough rosemary to make 100 loaves... I just may do that. _  \n    \n    \nI used the recipe from Jamie Cooks It Up! with limited changes.   \n    \n### Macaroni Grill Rosemary Bread  \nYield: 2 loaves  \n    \n2 packets (1.5 tbsp) active dry yeast  \n1 cup warm water  \n1/4 tsp sugar  \n1 1/2 tsp salt  \n3 tbsp olive oil (I used extra virgin)  \n2 3/4 cups all purpose flour  \n1/2 teaspoon mixed oregano, basil, and garlic powder (equal parts of each to total 1/2 teaspoon)  \n1/4 teaspoon black pepper, cracked  \n1 1/2 tbsp fresh rosemary needles, with stems chopped off  \n    \n1 egg  \nbutter  \nsea salt  \n    \n1\\. Combine in the bottom of your mixer bowl the yeast, warm water, and sugar. Mix it gently with a spoon to incorporate. Let it sit and rise for 5 minutes.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G_ThrXr5w5c/T9EqI8xyFHI/AAAAAAAAADg/bEzDiEo1Mw8/s640/photo+4.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G_ThrXr5w5c/T9EqI8xyFHI/AAAAAAAAADg/bEzDiEo1Mw8/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n    \n_My yeast was so plump!_  \n    \n2\\. Add the salt, olive oil, and 1 cup of the flour. Mix it for about 1 minute on a low setting. Change to your bread hook attachment.   \n    \n3\\. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Once all the flour is in, let your bread hook knead on high in your mixer for 5-7 minutes.   \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CQeK-wyQ_Q4/T9EqNcqHS5I/AAAAAAAAAD8/TWHTjNG305k/s640/photo+2.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CQeK-wyQ_Q4/T9EqNcqHS5I/AAAAAAAAAD8/TWHTjNG305k/s1600/photo+2.JPG)  \n    \n    \n4\\. While the mixer is working its magic, chop up your rosemary. Mix it with the herbs and pepper so the rosemary is coated in the herbs. Add to the bread dough.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FT34K8H3Yrk/T9EqL9kv6GI/AAAAAAAAAD0/meebMOC2teg/s320/photo+1.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FT34K8H3Yrk/T9EqL9kv6GI/AAAAAAAAAD0/meebMOC2teg/s1600/photo+1.JPG)[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_fYVTCzW6lY/T9EqHVDbHZI/AAAAAAAAADY/u5a5N9EjG4E/s320/photo+3.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_fYVTCzW6lY/T9EqHVDbHZI/AAAAAAAAADY/u5a5N9EjG4E/s1600/photo+3.JPG)  \n    \n    \n5\\. Thoroughly wet a clean kitchen rag and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to heat it up. Place this over the bowl to let the dough rise for 40 minutes, or until doubled in size. No need to put it in a warm oven if the rag is moist and warm. My dough not only doubled, but perhaps tripled. This is fine.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-63hWtnOwYLY/T9EqOxykSiI/AAAAAAAAAEE/yEYtIelH9iA/s320/photo+3.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-63hWtnOwYLY/T9EqOxykSiI/AAAAAAAAAEE/yEYtIelH9iA/s1600/photo+3.JPG)[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HScmKSxDwns/T9EqQDgZK-I/AAAAAAAAAEM/DINKOlRC2sE/s320/photo+4.JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HScmKSxDwns/T9EqQDgZK-I/AAAAAAAAAEM/DINKOlRC2sE/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n    \n    \n6\\. Divide the dough in half and place the two balls of dough on a greased cookie sheet or a baking stone sprayed with a bit of olive oil.   \n    \n7\\. Beat the egg and brush it on the two dough balls.   \n    \n8\\. Place the baking stone with the two loaves in the oven heated up to 175 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave them in the oven for 15 minutes to double in size.  \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO0l-uOYJo/T9EqRrZC2KI/AAAAAAAAAEU/xy46j-miCzU/s640/photo+5.JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO0l-uOYJo/T9EqRrZC2KI/AAAAAAAAAEU/xy46j-miCzU/s1600/photo+5.JPG)  \n    \n    \n9\\. With the loaves still inside, turn the oven up to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. From the time you turn the oven up, it should take 20-25 minutes for the loaves to bake.   \n    \n10\\. Take the loaves out when they have a nice golden color to the crust. Brush butter on each loaf and sprinkle with sea salt.   \n    \n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-30rleQQWAYI/T9Ep7FWp_6I/AAAAAAAAACw/WZzMYa82urY/s640/photo+3.JPG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-30rleQQWAYI/T9Ep7FWp_6I/AAAAAAAAACw/WZzMYa82urY/s1600/photo+3.JPG)  \n    \n_\"Make sure to get my diamonds in there!\" -Mom _  \n    \n    \n11\\. Eat it while it's hot... if there's any left!  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YojLHQvrA30/T9Ep-aSvTYI/AAAAAAAAAC4/nIhk0RI6O3Q/s640/photo+4.JPG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YojLHQvrA30/T9Ep-aSvTYI/AAAAAAAAAC4/nIhk0RI6O3Q/s1600/photo+4.JPG)  \n_They should sell a Scentsy scent called \"Macaroni Grill Bread.\" I would certainly buy it. My house smells amazing right now. _  \nI'm so glad I decided to make this bread, because the whole Lorelai and Luke breakup was depressing me too much. When in doubt, always ask yourself, _What would the Barefoot Contessa Do?_ I decided she would make bread."

        "markdown": "Hello. My name is Nea and I am a baker.  \nMy interests include delicious sugary confections, Friends reruns, anything involving butter, and designing and making clothes. I am currently a last month high school senior who is headed off to BYU Provo in the fall.  \n  \n_I plan on being a domestic goddess someday. _  \n  \nTonight, in the hopes of procrastinating on studying for my AP Music Theory test tomorrow, I decided to take on a daring baker's challenge: _the Parisienne Macaron._ The beautiful colors have always tickled me pink (as you will see later) and the mere thought of baking these delicate French cookies can send bakers running! I was up for a challenge tonight.  \n    \n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zs1ltkhvzP8/T7CC_UUvsiI/AAAAAAAAACM/xPImOoyDfp8/s320/macarons.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zs1ltkhvzP8/T7CC_UUvsiI/AAAAAAAAACM/xPImOoyDfp8/s1600/macarons.jpg)  \n_Just look at those vibrant colors! Gorgeous._   \n  \nI decided to opt for Martha Stewart's recipe because, honestly, it was the only recipe I could find using standard measurements instead of metric units! Martha's recipe can be found [here](http://www.marthastewart.com/318387/french-macaroons?czone=food/cookies-cnt/specialty-cookies&center=276956&gallery=275448&slide=285746). I wasn't feeling up to driving to the store, so I had to make my own almond flour by grinding up the almonds we had in our mini food processor. I added a few drops of red food coloring to the egg/sugar mixture to give them the gorgeous pink color. I followed the recipe other than my homemade almond flour.  \n    \n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VY33N9fzC20/T7B82JSx_SI/AAAAAAAAABg/YPcf2JoKhJk/s320/photo+(12).JPG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VY33N9fzC20/T7B82JSx_SI/AAAAAAAAABg/YPcf2JoKhJk/s1600/photo+(12).JPG)  \n    \nMartha warned to start in the middle and work out with the piping tip because you don't want a peak in the middle. Although the recipe said they only need 10 minutes some of mine took about 12-13 minutes.   \n    \nI originally took them out at 10 minutes, but I found that the insides of the macarons were too gummy and came out as I tried to take them off the pan. I put the pan back in the oven for 3 more minutes and they were perfect.   \n    \n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-psLusiAexYM/T7B_pd38nXI/AAAAAAAAABs/U2s4KWTi4cc/s320/photo+(13).JPG)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-psLusiAexYM/T7B_pd38nXI/AAAAAAAAABs/U2s4KWTi4cc/s1600/photo+(13).JPG)  \n_Freshly frosted!_  \n    \nI think they turned out very pretty!
